Despite the increasing interest in Thai-Western musical integration among \nThai classical composers and ethnomusicologists, no extensive studies have yet explored the \nintegration of Thai music with jazz in the context of the contemporary jazz orchestra. \nFurthermore, while some musical traditions, such as those of South Asia and of the Arab \nworld, have long been combined with jazz, there have been few such explorations of fusing \njazz with Thai music traditions.  \n \nUnlike previous Thai musical hybridity projects or cross-cultural Thai musical composition \nstudies, this research project considers four regional Thai music practices instead of assuming \nthe existence of a single “traditional music of Thailand.” I approach such musical practices \nfrom a jazz composition perspective in this study. In my research methods I identified and \ndescribed their key elements, including fundamental structures, performance methods, and \nidiomatic instruments. I then transcribed performances by prominent Thai musicians \nworking in these traditions into Western notation. After that, I experimentally integrated \nsuch musical elements into jazz compositions and created prototypes before composing \nworks for full jazz orchestra. Inspired by the practice of cultural cosmopolitanism in Thailand \nand the openness to foreign cultures witnessed in Thai musical traditions, I also incorporated \nother musical techniques beyond jazz, including elements of rock, hip hop, R&B, and \nelectronica, into my contemporary jazz orchestra writing process to produce a unique \ncreative output for the study.  \nThe creative outcome of this research, Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand, consists of seven \noriginal jazz orchestra compositions totaling 67 minutes. The compositions demonstrate \nmusical hybridity in the ways the characteristics of Thai music combine with contemporary \njazz musical elements to produce new styles. In my critical analysis of these works, I begin \nwith general observations on compositional approach and an extensive theoretical analysis \nfrom the perspective of jazz composition. I go on to comprehensively examine the Thai \nelements that are infused, transformed, or otherwise present in the pieces, and then analyze \nthe compositional techniques employed in my musical hybridizations, discussing some of the \ninspirations behind them. \n",
    "4": " \n \n \niv \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n \nFirst and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to two of my doctoral supervisors, \nDr. Dave Lisik and Dr. Dave Wilson, who are overwhelmingly supportive of me. Without \nthem, this research project would not have been possible. Dr. Lisik’s compositional guidance \nhas greatly transformed how I think of composing jazz orchestra music from a decent quality \nto a professional one. His methodologies of jazz orchestra music productions have given me \noutstanding knowledge and effective strategies for producing high-quality jazz orchestra \nmusic, which have significantly benefited me as a jazz composer.  \n \nI am also thankful for Dr. Wilson for guiding me and spending time on my research \ncomponent. His mentorship encouraged me to step beyond my comfort zone as a jazz \nperformer and embark on a journey as an academic researcher. His advice has also been \ntremendously helpful in my doctoral studies and has assisted me to discover my role as a jazz \ncomposer. In the preparation of this dissertation, his editorial assistance is also immensely \nappreciated. It was an honor to be a doctoral student of both Dr. Lisik and Dr. Wilson  \nin Wellington, New Zealand. \nSecond, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my PhD examination committee, \nwhich included Associate Professor Michael Norris, Professor Dr. Deborah Wong, and \nProfessor Dr. Jack Cooper for reviewing both my creative outcomes and research \ncomponent, as well as providing invaluable feedback and suggestions. In addition, I would \nlike to express my heartfelt thanks to my previous jazz instructors at the University of New \nOrleans, particularly Professor Steve Masakowski, Edward Petersen, and Associate Professor \nVictor Atkins, who have always supported me in pursuing my academic goals in music and \nspent time completing letters of recommendation for both my portfolios and PhD \napplications in the past.  Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to two \ninterviewees, Khru Somnuek Saengarun and Professor Perico Sambeat, for giving their \nvaluable time to share their musical expertise in this research project. \nI would like to convey my gratefulness to Assistant Professor Wootichai Lertsatakit and \nAssociate Professor Dr. Saksri Vongtaradon for allowing me to take the first steps toward a \ncareer as a jazz instructor at the Faculty of Music, Silpakorn University, and to teach bass, \njazz composition and arranging, and university big-band class. This opportunity was a \n",

Their love \nand support mean a whole lot to me. And, importantly, I would like to wholeheartedly thank \nmy father, mother, sister, aunt, and all my family members for whom I cannot find words to \nexpress my deepest gratitude. Your love and care mean everything to me, and I owe \neverything I have to you all. I’m so lucky to be part of our family. \n",

I like the colorfulness and the complexity \nof jazz, and that something I want to happen with flamenco. Maybe, I have captured only two chords in \nflamenco, but I think we might have to get a task to go a little beyond and get a little far — as much as \nwe can, and know well which traditional music you want to work on and then take it to the complexity \nand the beauty of jazz both together. I mean you must know both of them deeply.1    \nPerico Sambeat \n \n1.1 THE PURPOSE OF STUDY \n \nWhat musical experiences do jazz composers encounter when learning to compose music \ninfluenced by Thai musical traditions? What practical methodologies can jazz composers apply \nto compose music in a process of Thai-jazz musical hybridization?

In addition, my mixed family heritages meant \nthat I was nurtured in an atmosphere featuring elements of both Thai-Chinese and Southern \nThai Buddhist cultures, a multicultural background that has had a direct impact on my personal \nidentity. \nMy jazz experience began at sixteen, the same age I discovered the music of Duke Ellington’s \njazz orchestra, which became one of my major inspirations to become a jazz orchestra \ncomposer. Unlike other jazz composers who may have been classically trained as children, I \nbegan my Western music education as a bass player by learning to transcribe and play along to \nrecordings of alternative rock, indie pop, and African-American music, including R&B, soul, \nand hip-hop. I believe this has had a significant effect on my musical development and a direct \nimpact on my compositional process, as evidenced by the original compositions I have \nproduced for this research. As a result, all of these personal influences are reflected in my \nartistic viewpoints and help establish my positioning as an artist, which has a consequence on \nthis investigation. \nIn this introductory chapter, I first provide a brief overview of various historical precedents for \nthis project, including examples of cross-cultural musical hybridization from early jazz to the \npresent day, and a brief discussion of the general lack of cross-cultural works for jazz orchestra \ninvolving Thai music. I then discuss the methodology of this project and the outline of this thesis, \nbefore brief discussions of my use of the terms “cross-cultural” and “musical hybridization,” as \nwell as my own positionality towards Thai musical traditions as a Thai person trained primarily \nin jazz composition and performance.   \n1.2 HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS FOR CROSS-CULTURAL JAZZ \nCOMPOSITIONS \nThough jazz is and has always been African American music, the process of composing jazz \nhas involved and been influenced by diverse musical elements beyond the musical practices of \nAfrican Americans. These distinct musical influences include, for example, the French \n",

Various Caribbean \nelements appear in several well-known early swing compositions, including “The Peanut \nVendor” (1931) and “Caravan” (1936), which were famously performed by Duke Ellington’s \norchestra, and “Chili-Con Conga” (1939), performed by Cab Calloway’s orchestra.  \nSome of the best illustrations of musical hybridization in bebop can be found in the music of \nDizzy Gillespie in the 1940s and 1950s, who was introduced to Afro-Cuban music by Mario \nBauzá. After starting his own band in 1947, Dizzy met Chano Pozo, a Cuban singer, dancer, \nand percussionist who helped Dizzy to invent “Cubop,” a clear example of musical hybridity. \nAfro-Cuban tumbao bass lines and the conga, an Afro-Cuban instrument of African origin, \nwere used alongside bebop improvisation and with other complex rhythms in a fast swing \ncontext. Better-known examples of this hybridization process in Gillespie’s music include “A \nNight in Tunisia” (1942) and “Manteca” (1947). Cubop became widespread during the late \n1940s and significantly influenced jazz composers and orchestra leaders, including George \nRussell and Stan Kenton.4  \nFlamenco is another musical style, in this case from Spain, that has been combined with jazz \nstyles in several well-known cases. Cross-cultural works combining flamenco and jazz include \nLionel Hampton’s “Jazz Flamenco” (1956), John Coltrane’s “Olé” (1961), some elements of \nCharles Mingus’s album Tijuana Moods (recorded 1957, released 1962) and the jazz orchestra \nwork Sketches of Spain, a 1960 collaboration between Miles Davis and Gil Evans.  \n \nStylistic crossovers in compositional processes among jazz composers continued and further \nexpanded in musical style in the 1960s and 1970s. Don Ellis was active in this vein, with \n                                                        \n2 Rashida K. Braggs, Jazz Diasporas: Race, Music, and Migration in Post-World War II Paris, (Berkley: University of \nCalifornia Press, 2016), 44. \n3 “New Orleans Blues” was first record as a piano solo in 1923 and published in 1925. See the IMSLP Petrucci \nMusic Library at https://imslp.org/New_Orleans_Blues_(Morton,_Jelly_Roll). \n4 For more details see Paul Austerlitz and Jere Laukkanen, Machito and his Afro-Cubans: Selected Transcriptions \n(Middleton: A-R Editions, 2016).  \n",

Ellis’s group also \nperformed “Bulgarian Bulge” (1969), which drew on Bulgarian folk rhythms. Other jazz \ncomposers like Toshiko Akiyoshi and Salah Ragab also brought musical elements from their \nhome countries, Japan and Egypt, respectively, into jazz compositions. These include \nAkiyoshi’s Kogun (1974), in which she employed Japanese traditional percussion instruments \nand the Japanese traditional singing style called nohgaku. Egyptian Jazz, by Salah Ragab and the \nCairo Jazz band (recorded in 1968 and reissued 2017 by Art Yard Records), is an example of \nEgyptian music performed by a large jazz ensemble, and of Middle Eastern influence on jazz \norchestra music.  \nThe embrace of diverse musical practices in jazz composition has continued to the present, as \nseen in the more recent performance of “Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton \nMarsalis” (2013) featuring the Sachal Ensemble, a traditional music ensemble from Pakistan. \nIn this performance, audiences witness the intermingling of blues from the saxophones and \nbrass sections of the jazz orchestra, the musical language of bebop, including improvisation, \nand a strong swing feel with the sound of traditional Pakistani instruments such as the bansuri, \ntabla, and sitar, instruments which also have connections with other South Asian traditions such \nas Hindustani classical music and Carnatic music. Another recent example of a cross-cultural \nmusic project is the collaboration between German Frankfurt Radio Big Band (hr-Bigband) \nand the renowned Lebanese oud player Rabih Abou-Khalil, playing works arranged and directed \nby Jim McNeely, a prominent American composer of jazz orchestra music. \nThe flexibility of jazz and the openness of jazz musicians to seemingly endless musical \ninfluences from around the world can be witnessed in the multicultural practices of jazz \nthroughout its history. Duke Ellington also comments on the concept of its musical diversity:  \nJazz is a tree, and it has many branches that reach out many directions, of course, it goes \ninto the far east and picks up its exotic blossom, and at the end of each branch is a twig. \nIt goes east, west, north, south, and everywhere it goes it pick up some certain influence. \n[…] As it goes down into the deep roots into the earth then you find out these blue-\nblooded black roots are deep in the soil of black Africa which is of course the foundation \nof everything that is with the beat. The beat that of course today is the most listened to \nin the world.5  \n                                                        \n5 “Duke Ellington - What Jazz Is,” YouTube, uploaded by Jazz Video Guy. \n<www.youtube.com/watch?v=brAZ9JnWDjI&t=33s>, (7 September 2020). \n",

When I hear his music, I want to copy it—not note for note of course, \nbut in his spirit. What bring me closest to Ravi is the modal aspect of his art. Currently, at the particular \nstage I find myself in, I seem to be going through a modal phase … There’s a lot of modal music that is \nplayed every day throughout the world. It’s particularly evident in Africa, but if you look at Spain or \nScotland, India or China, you’ll discover this again in each case.6 \nDespite the numerous examples of cross-cultural jazz projects mentioned above, there still \nremains a dearth of such hybrids of jazz and traditional Thai music, particularly with regard to \ncontemporary jazz orchestra compositions that have yet to be explored in jazz research. In fact, \neven with the presence of jazz since the 1930s in Bangkok, jazz was initially only performed by \na small number of people in Thailand, and the music was appreciated mostly by those in the \nelite or middle classes who had earned diplomas in Western countries.7 After decades of jazz \nactivity in Thailand, the College of Music at Mahidol University eventually established the first \nThai jazz studies program in 1998. This was the first music institution in Thailand where music \nstudents could enroll in jazz courses and earn a Bachelor of Arts (BA).8 Yet, extensive research \nthat is focused on cross-cultural jazz orchestra compositions is still rare in Thai jazz education. \nFor these reasons, this research offers an opportunity to experiment, develop, and produce \ncreative works that significantly contribute to the field of cross-cultural music composition. \nTherefore, the explicit purpose of this study is fourfold: 1) to create a new work that is the \nresult of the musical hybridization of jazz and Thai music traditions; 2) to apply knowledge of \ntraditional Thai music to jazz compositions; 3) to demonstrate through comprehensive musical \nanalysis how the characteristics of Thai music are reproduced and adapted in jazz orchestra \npieces; and 4) to offer a jazz composer’s experiential account of working in musical hybridity.  \n1.3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  \nMy research methodology for this project has been drawn from multiple sources. Just as I did \nearlier in my life when first acquiring a jazz vocabulary as a bass player and composer, I set \nabout learning Thai music by transcribing recordings of compositions to develop a better \nunderstanding of how such music works from a jazz composer’s perspective. This process is \n                                                        \n6 Quoted in Lewis Porter, John Coltrane His Life and Music (Ann Arbor: University Michigan Press, 1999), 211. \n7 Jittapim Yamprai, “The Establishment of Western Music in Thailand,” PhD Diss., University of Northern \nColorado (2011), 70. \n8 College of Music, Mahidol University, “History,” <https://www.music.mahidol.ac.th/history/>. \n",

You move from the imitation stage to the \nassimilation stage when you take little bits of things from different people and weld them into an \nidentifiable style-creating your own style.9  \nNext, I assess these transcriptions from the perspectives of Thai musicians in order to gain a \npractical understanding of how Thai music is genuinely performed. I then restate these new \nfindings in jazz terminology, which I believe the majority of my readers, who are jazz \npractitioners, will be able to understand. As with recordings of a jazz standard, Thai recordings \nexist in several renditions, each performed differently depending on how the performers were \ntaught by their masters, or if they are music teachers themselves, their own interpretation. The \nThai recordings I selected for my study had a profound influence on this research. To provide \na practical approach for this study, I chose Thai music recordings that were performed by well-\nrespect Thai musicians or recorded by Thai music ensembles established by Thai universities \nwith Thai music studies programs. \nThe second element of my methodology is a study of the existing literature on Thai music. A \nnumber of publications by both Western and Thai scholars who are experts in the field, such \nas Montri Tramote, David Morton, Terry E. Miller, Panya Roongruang, Anant Narkkong, \nDeborah Wong, Kumkom Pornprasit, and John Garzoli, to name a few, also played a crucial \nrole in helping me to acquire extensive knowledge of Thai music. I reference these experts’ \narguments and discussions in several chapters of this research. The scope of such discussions \nis also extended to the historical and social aspects of Thai musical practice, to present a clearer \npicture of Thai performers’ musical purpose and identity. In addition, I returned to Thailand \nin 2019 to conduct archival research in multiple libraries in Thailand. On this trip, I uncovered \nseveral Western-notated scores (transcriptions) of significant Thai works, which I also studied \nand employed in my compositional process. \n \nTo gain a perspective on genuine Thai music-making practice and issues surrounding the \ncultural appropriation of Thai music traditions, I also interviewed Somuek Saengarun, a \nprominent Thai classical musician who has worked in several cross-cultural music projects both \nin Thailand and overseas. This interview also revealed much about the attitudes of Thai classical \n                                                        \n9 Quoted in Paul Berliner, Thinking in Jazz: The Infinite Art of Improvisation, 120. \n",

This interview also revealed much about \nthe attitudes of Thai classical musicians toward musical hybridization or cross-cultural music \nworks, the stylistic difference between Thai classical music and other regional traditional Thai \nmusic, and some successful Western musical approaches to Thai classical music. \nIn my approach to studies of jazz composition, I explored previous cross-cultural jazz orchestra \nprojects through score study and listening, with special attention to aspects of cross-cultural \nmusic making. This process yielded a clearer picture of the compositional processes employed \nin integrating culturally distinct musical elements. I also further investigated the perspectives \nof the composers of these projects in articles and related dissertations.  \nScholarly work on the notion of the globalization of jazz and the adaptation of jazz to local \nmusic cultures also provided significant contributions to this research. Scholars in this field \nsuch as Stuart Nicholson, E. Taylor Atkins, and Bruce Johnson led me to discover more cross-\ncultural jazz composers, to review the historical background of jazz-influenced music outside \nthe United States, and to examine artistic attitudes toward the products and processes of \ncrossovers between jazz and the local music cultures of Scandinavia, Japan, and Australia. \nIn parallel to my investigations of Thai music, I interviewed a prominent cross-cultural jazz \ncomposer, Perico Sambeat, a professor at Berklee College of Music in Valencia who has \nrecorded several successful jazz orchestra albums that contained elements of flamenco and \njazz. In this interview, Perico explicitly demonstrated several compositional processes through \nwhich he incorporates flamenco musical elements into his jazz orchestra works. He also offered \nhis artistic perspective on the argument between traditionalism and modernism in the criticism \nand perception of cross-cultural music.10  \nFor the compositional analysis and discussion of my original compositions, which is the \ncornerstone of this research, I chose to adopt the practical methods of musical analysis of \nRayburn Wright’s Inside the Score (1982), Richard Lawn’s Jazz Score and Analysis (2018), and Bill \nDobbins’s Composing and Arranging for the Contemporary Big Band (2014), all of which are widely \nused in jazz composition studies.

For a pragmatist, outcomes are examined through practical concerns and \ntheoretical findings must be validated by their practical consequences. A pragmatist is also \ninterested in putting concepts, theories, and techniques to the test to discover how well they \nperform in practice. As William James, a significant contributor to the development of \npragmatism, says, “True ideas are those that we can assimilate, validate, corroborate, and verify. \nFalse ideas are those that we cannot.”11 \nAs a result, my musical work, Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand, is the product of the practical \nresults that have been implemented into the four distinct processes, including:  \n1) selecting a Thai composition that contains musical features that are presumed to \nfunction in a jazz context;  \n2) transcribing such Thai recordings in order to gain a better understanding in terms \nof practical consideration, and then analyzing the transcripts from a jazz \nperspective;  \n3) composing a preliminary or prototype work for a small ensemble using features of \nThai music revealed through transcriptions and combined with jazz musical \nelements;  \n4) producing musical works for a jazz orchestra by expanding on these Thai music \nelements and assimilating new Thai music ideas that can be practically incorporated \ninto the jazz composition process. \nFurthermore, my intention in composing the music for this research project is clear: I would \nlike to produce music that not only provides audiences with an experience of Thai sonorities, \nbut also goes beyond traditional features of the jazz orchestra repertoire by offering \n                                                        \n11 Donald A.

However, as suggested by Perico Sambeat in his interview \nwith me, “The advice that I would like to give to someone who aspires to be a cross-cultural \njazz composer is that he or she should be concerned in both [types of] music, and he or she \nshould study both of them deeply, and the more deeply he or she knows, the better he or she \ndoes.”13 Therefore, my attention in this study may go beyond the purely compositional \nviewpoints to investigate those aspects of wider culture and society that might help jazz \ncomposers to understand how these musicians genuinely practice their music.  \nThis thesis is divided into seven chapters, with this introduction serving as Chapter 1. In \nChapter 2, a literature review, I begin by examining a case study of previous cross-cultural \nmusic projects and artistic experiments to demonstrate how jazz can be combined with other \nmusical elements: flamenco; Scandinavian music (Nordic tones); the traditional music of \nBulgaria, Indian, Japan, and Indonesia; and Australian folk music. This is followed by a \ndiscussion of literature on cross-cultural composition studies in Thailand, with several \nexamples of Thai composers’ attitudes on cross-cultural music projects.

I also briefly discuss the formation of the modern Thai nation with reference \nto the work of Sujit Wongthes, David K. Wyatt, Chris Baker, and Pasuk Phongpaichit. Later, \nI embark upon a discussion of Thai classical music (dontri thai doem) with reference to the pitch \nproduction of Thai instruments and the characteristic melodic lines (which I refer to as “Thai \nmelodic patterns”) implemented in lyrical compositions, as well as texture, rhythm, meter, \ncompositional techniques, and musical form. I situate these musical characteristics as vital to \nthis project, as they lend themselves well to processes of hybridization of Thai classical music \nwith jazz orchestra music. I then discuss two “prototype compositions” of mine, where I \nexperiment with applying principles of Thai classical music to jazz material in preparation for \ncomposing my own larger-scale works. The first composition applies the augmentation and \ndiminution techniques employed in thao compositions to John Coltrane’s composition “Giant \nSteps.” The second composition, “Nanapa,” uses several Thai classical music composition \ntechniques such as thang kro (tremolo), luk thao (sustained pitches), and luk lo luk kut (call and \nresponse). \nChapter 4 examines the traditional music of northeast Thailand (dontri isan nuea), beginning with \na general description of the musical practice in this region, drawing on the work of Charoen \nChaichonphairote.

For a selection of musical instruments, I then \nprovide a brief description of their performance practices, illustrated by transcriptions of \nperformances of the pi jum (free-reed pipe), salo (three-stringed spike fiddle), and sueng (plucked, \nfretted lute). I also include my transcriptions of “Saw Dad Nan” and “Saw Pan Fai,” two well-\nknown compositions in repertoires of northern Thai traditional music.

Though the term “cross-cultural” is primarily associated with \npsychology and social science, it has also been employed in musicology, in particular when \nreferring to the crossover between Western and non-Western music. Jin-Ah Kim remarks on \nthe term “cross-cultural” in her essay, “Cross-cultural Music Making: Concepts, Conditions, \nand Perspectives”:15 \n \nOriginally, it was used in empirical studies in order to compare different cultures based on \nstatistics. Over the course of time, however, in particular since the 1980s, the term has been \nincreasingly used in the sense of interaction and integration between culture.16 \n \nI find the term “cross-cultural” useful to some extent, though I understand that “cultures” are \nmore flexible, elastic, and porous than the concept implies, especially in particular forms of \njazz, which is indeed a multicultural music genre. However, after spending four years living in \nNew Orleans, where many people agree that the origin of jazz is certainly associated with \nmulticulturalism, I have found that it is critical to clearly identify jazz as an African American \nmusical tradition.17 For example, Nicholas Payton, a New Orleans native trumpeter underlined \n                                                        \n14 See Appendix D for the seven scores of my original jazz orchestra compositions. \n15 Jin-Ah Kim, “Cross-Cultural Music Making: Concepts, Conditions and Perspectives,” International Review of the \nAesthetics and Sociology of Music 48, no.1 (2017), 20.    \n16 Ibid., 20.  \n17 See more Wynton Marsalis’s interview, “for Wynton Marsalis, forgetting the roots of jazz is forgetting the \nhistory of race in America,” \n<https://wyntonmarsalis.org/news/entry/forgetting-the-roots-of-jazz-is-forgetting-the-history-of-race-in-\namerica> (12 January 2018) and Eric Porter writing in the first chapter, Incorporation and Distinction in Jazz \n",

And that’s not to say who can and cannot play this music. But without \naddressing the community part and who created the music — that’s wrong.”18   \n \nJazz researcher Lewis Porter also advises jazz scholars that, when conducting  research on jazz, \nit is critical to view this music from a black perspective as much as possible.19 My stance is that \njazz is clearly African American music, and therefore, when I try to illustrate the process of \nmaking music that combines jazz (African American music traditions) with other musical \nelements, I still consider that the term “cross-cultural” may be useful for readers to understand \nhow two distinct musical elements are integrated or to which degree those two musical \nelements are combined.  \n \nThe origin of the word “hybridity” is the Latin hybrida, which identifies the offspring of a \ndomestic sow and a wild boar.20 According to Jean-Paul Baldacchino, although this word was \napplied to celebrate the mixture of cultures and languages, the word hybridity also renders it \nproblematic, in particular in the context of nineteenth-century racial discourse. However, in \nthe age of globalization, as Baldacchino explains, this word commonly refers to “cultural \ndifferences,” “cultural fusion,” or “celebrat[ing] diversity.”21 Although the word hybridity is \nnot a perfect description of my work, and despite the potential negative connotations, it \nappears to better reflect the nature of my creative works than related words such as “cross-”, \n“inter-”, “trans-” or “fusion”, because my works are indeed the product of the combination of \nmore than two distinct musical cultures to establish a new musical language that sounds distinct \nfrom its constituent parts. Moreover, I consider this word to offer a “third space” for this \nproject, a new dimension where my jazz composition knowledge encounters Thai music \ntradition practices in order to create new musical works that are autonomous in terms of both \nauthenticity and authorship.22 Recognizing that both are imperfect concepts, I generally use \n                                                        \nHistory and Jazz Historiography Jazz/Not Jazz: The Music and Its Boundaries, (University of California Press, \n2012), 15-18. \n18 The Mercury News, “Nicholas Payton speaks: about jazz and #BAM” \n<https://www.mercurynews.com/2013/10/03/nicholas-payton-speaks-about-jazz-and-bam/>  \n(12 August 2016).  \n19Lewis Porter, “Some problems in Jazz Research,” Black Music Journal 8, no.2 (1998), 199. \n20 Marwan M.

For those interested in jazz approaching my work, \nI hope to expand their understanding of Thai traditional music, to better understand the main \ntraditional practices in Thailand, in their typical categorization into four regions (dontri si pak \nดนตรีสี6ภาค), described previously. In fact, even though English-language studies of Thai classical \nmusic research are numerous, studies of regional traditional Thai music, in particular the study \nof the traditional music of southern Thailand, where nora and rong ngeng are practiced, are \nlacking. Consequently, by contributing this research, I hope that the “other traditional Thai \nmusic,” which is practiced outside the area of the center of Thailand will draw more attention \nfrom music researchers in the future.23    \n1.7 PERSONAL STATEMENT  \nBecause my works are directly associated with Thai musical practices, I would like to provide \na personal statement regarding Kwarm pen Thai (Thainess). Indeed, the perception of Thainess \nand Thai identity are ambiguous depending on the experiences and value system of individual \nartists. However, John Garzoli emphasizes the importance of such a concept which he \nexplained that “Thai musicians regard this concept (Thainess) as being central to the creation \nand evaluation of their work” and “Thai musicians generally had clear views about what is ‘real \nThai’ and what was not.”24 Therefore, it is also important to me to present my personal attitude \ntoward the interpretation of my works, and state my position on Thai music traditions.  \nAs a Thai student who grew up in a modern society in Bangkok, I learned the concept of Thai \nidentity through the standard Thai school curriculum, which is to some degree associated with \nnationalism.25 However, since I have spent more time studying outside these standard \n                                                        \n23 Aside from these four groups of musical traditions, there are several ethnic minority music practices in Thailand, \nsuch as Karen, Hmong, Akha, and Lawa musical cultures, which also require further research. \n24 John Garzoli, “Intonational, Idiomatic, and Historical Factors That Shape Contemporary Thai Fusion Music,” \nPhD diss., Monash University (2014), 30-31. \n25See, David Wyatt’s chapter “The Rise of Elite Nationalism”, in 210-222.

What makes Thai cultures fascinating to me is that they are results of the \npractice of cultural diversity which can be witnessed both in the past and in present-day \nThailand. As I have embraced this diversity more deeply, multiculturalism is also reflected in \nmy works, in which I try to demonstrate the influences on my creativity of traditions beyond \nThai music and jazz, such as Latin American music, alternative rock, and hip-hop.  \nMoreover, I would like to highlight that the creative works of this project should not be \ninterpreted as a work of nationalism, as in examples where a Thai person tries to promote Thai \nculture. I have decided to conduct this research because, regardless of my nationality, I have \nbeen inspired by other types of traditional music, in particular, in the southeast Asian region. \nAdditionally, I assume that attempting to determine the border of such traditional music \npractices by using a modern concept of national borders would be a major mistake, as I shall \nhighlight how cultural diversity influenced Thai music tradition’s musical practices in Chapter \n3. To me, it seemed logical, in composing hybrid jazz I consider to be global, to start with Thai \nmusical traditions, since I am able to draw on Thai musical knowledge written in Thai or shared \nverbally in Thai. I am also able to find suitable Thai musicians’ recordings that can serve as \ncompelling resources for future jazz compositions (by me and other jazz composers), even as \nI have spent most of my time conducting this research in Wellington, New Zealand. In \naddition, I believe that we do not need to be native-born to legitimately learn traditional music. \nEvery kind of musical knowledge, indeed, requires significant time and effort to master. Yet, \nin my opinion, the most important thing we need to do is clearly comprehend such musical \nknowledge and approach it ethically with consideration of our positionalities.  \nThat being said, I would like to clarify my position as “an outsider” to Thai music traditions. \nEven though I am Thai and grew up in Thailand, I neither had opportunities to attend any \nritual ceremonies (wai khru)26 nor have a family heritage in Thai music. In addition, the almost \nnine years I have spent outside Thailand (five in the USA and nearly four in New Zealand) \nhave changed how I think about Thai cultures. Even if I consider myself an “outsider” to Thai \nmusic traditions, this does not necessarily imply that I am somehow beyond the social-cultural \nboundaries of Thai practices, as I was nurtured in a middle-class Thai household with Thai \n                                                        \n26 A wai khru is a ceremony of paying homage and respect to music teacher. The ceremonies intend to honor \nteachers while is allow pupils to ask for their teacher’s blessing. See Chapter 3, in the sacred ceremonies section. \n",

As a result, I would like to stress that this study \nshould not be misinterpreted as having been produced by someone working entirely outside \nof their own culture, which might have connotations of cultural exploitation and colonialism. \nI would like also to underline that while I employ Western music notation to describe Thai \nmusical practices from a jazz standpoint, I have no intention of overlooking or denigrating \nThai musical knowledge. My purpose is clear: I employ this method to transfer Thai music \npractices into a musical language accessible to jazz practitioners. As a consequence, this is the \nwork of a modern Thai striving to develop his personal identity by reconciling his ancestor’s \nlegacy with his own beliefs.  In addition, my personal approach to these musical hybridizations \nis that of a contemporary artist working in Thai music traditions and their innovative potential \nrather than an artist seeking to adopt a purist or traditional perspective. Furthermore, my \ncreative work should be understood as generated from the perspective of a jazz composer \nseeking new ways to create music for a jazz orchestra and exploring Thai musical elements to \nincorporate into his jazz compositions. \nFinally, I would like to mention that the overriding concern when making music for this project \nis “to be respectful”; as I discovered, the concept of obedience and discipline is considered a \ncore value of Thai music traditions. In addition, I would like to pay my respects to Thai music \nteachers who create and develop the knowledge of these styles of music, and to inform those \nwho continue to uphold Thai music traditions that my creative works constitute a \ncontemporary music project produced by a jazz musician genuinely fascinated by Thai music \ntraditions. The aim of this work is to introduce the aspects of Thai music into another branch \nin the tree of jazz, as Duke Ellington put it, adding Thai music traditions, through my \nknowledge of jazz composition and my individual artistic expression, to the many languages \nthat characterize jazz today. Even after completing this project, I still believe that there is much \nthat I can learn from Thai musical traditions, and much that can be applied to my jazz \ncomposition process. \n \n",

In the final section—\nwhich relates to the literature on Thai music studies—I demonstrate how the significant \nethnomusicological research in traditional music in Thailand can be beneficial to jazz \ncomposers.  \n \n2.2 A REVIEW OF CROSS-CULTURAL JAZZ ORCHESTRA LITERATURE \n \nThe musical practices of Andalusians, principally flamenco, have long attracted the attention \nof jazz performers, composers, and researchers. For example, in Peter Manuel’s 2016 essay \n“Flamenco Jazz: An Analytical Study,”28 the author provides a comprehensive insight into how \nthe two distinct musical styles have been combined. In this study, Manuel evaluates the artistic \nattitudes and works from the early stages of Paco de Lucía’s musical hybrids in the 1970s, and \nprovides observations on several of Chick Corea’s compositions and the artistic movement of \nflamenco jazz in the 1990s. In discussions of this movement, he concentrates on pianist and \ncomposer Chano Domínguez, and describes him as responsible for “the true flowering of \nFlamenco jazz” in his successful adaptation of the bulerías, a flamenco rhythm, into the blues, \nas well as in his use of jazz harmonies to accompany malagueña, a traditional singing style. \nManuel then extensively demonstrates the compatible and incompatible concepts between jazz \nand flamenco, comparing the musical forms and harmonic construction of the styles with one \nanother. In addition, Manuel provides a comprehensive analysis of a solo by pianist Alex \nConde, a prominent flamenco jazz artist. This improvisation illustrates the use of idiosyncratic \njazz and flamenco elements as well as the application of the bulería rhythm over the chordal \nresources of the Phrygian mode. \n \nStephanie Stein Crease explores the significance of using a Spanish-influenced style in a jazz \norchestra album in her discussion of Miles Davis and Gil Evans’s Sketches of Spain (1960). 29  \nCrease discusses the album’s musical adaptation of Saeta (the religious music of Andalusians) \nand its musical interpretation of Soleá (a traditional flamenco form). These two musical \nelements significantly influenced the creation of two compositions from Sketches of Spain, \n                                                        \n28 Peter Manuel, “Flamenco Jazz: An Analytical Study,” Journal of Jazz Studies 1, no.2 (2016), \n 29-35. \n29 Stephanie Stein Crease, Gil Evans: Out of the Cool: His Life and Music (Chicago Review Press, 2003) \n",

In \nDavis’s words: \n \nNow that was the hardest thing for me to do on Sketches of Spain. To play the parts on the trumpet where \nsomeone was supposed to be singing, especially when it was ad-libbed, like most of the time… After we \nfinished working on Sketches of Spain, I didn’t have nothing inside of me. I was drained of all emotion \nand I didn’t want to hear that music after I got through playing all that hard shit.30 \nSergio Pamies Rodriguez’s dissertation on flamenco jazz provides further insight on this \nparticular cross-cultural music. He explores the historical integration of these two musical \nstyles—despite the lack of agreement between critics and journalists in classifying this particular \ngenre from an anthropological perspective.31 In Rodriguez’s words, “while critics and \njournalists have articulated some of their critiques according to the expectations of the [genre] \nlabel instead of the quality of the music, the musicians do not seem to give any importance to \nthe label itself.”32 Rodriguez’s research also shares Chick Corea’s commentary on descriptions \nof this crossover music: \nThe flamenco goes this way, and the jazz goes this way, but then, later they meet. Now in the world they \nmeet. When me and Paco meet, we play music—I don’t know what you call it. People call it flamenco \njazz... but it’s definitely some of my favorite ways to make music.33 \nIn his musical analytic approach, Rodriguez illustrates successful cases in which the two musical \nelements have been synthesized. For example, he discusses the adaptation of bebop language \nin the improvisations of Jorge Pardo—a Spanish flute and saxophone player—and the \nutilization of flamenco guitar approaches, such as alzapúa and picados which Chick Corea \nincorporated for his solo on “Touchstone” (1982) from his album of the same name. Rodriguez \nalso examines the work of Pedro Iturralde, a well-known Spanish saxophonist. He explains \nIturrald’s creative process as similar to Walter Bishop Jr.’s concept, comparable to my research \nmethodology as described earlier. To describe Iturralde’s compositional process, Rodriguez \nstates:  \nIturralde certainly took elements from Davis and Coltrane’s famous recordings and demonstrated that \nanother kind of jazz was possible and showed what would make this new music different. He used the \nflamenco rhythmic elements of its styles (palos), the flamenco melodic gestures, and the flamenco \n                                                        \n30 Quoted in ibid., 210. \n31 Sergio Pamies Rodriguez, “The Controversial Identity of Flamenco Jazz: A New Historical and Analytical \nApproach,” DMA diss., University of North Texas (2016). \n32 Ibid., 104. \n33 Quoted in ibid., 115. \n",

He combined of all of them in a sophisticated and integrated hybridization with \njazz performance practices at the highest level… Iturralde attempted to accomplish all of the above, \nintroducing more elements from flamenco than any of his predecessors.34 \nImportantly, Rodriguez highlights several jazz orchestra projects that contain flamenco \nelements. These compositions and albums include Jazzpaña (1993) by Vince Mendoza and Arif \nMardin (from the WDR Big Band in Cologne), Victoria Suite (2010) by Chano Domínguez and \nWynton Marsalis with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, Flamenco Big Band by Perico Sambeat \n(2009), and Bulería, Soleá y Rumba (2004) by Maria Schneider. He argues that the aesthetics of \nflamenco jazz should not be overlooked in jazz education and that this cross-cultural music \ngenre has the potential to inspire other international jazz musicians to broaden jazz’s cultural \ndiversity.35  \nThe prominent jazz author and critic Stuart Nicholson has made a significant contribution to \nresearch on cultural diversity in jazz, from historical analyses to discussions of present-day \nmusical practices. One of his underlying concepts is that jazz spread by a process of cultural \ndiffusion in what he calls “the Globalization of Jazz.”36 His books and essays—including Is \nJazz Dead? Or Has It Moved to a New Address? (2005), Jazz and Culture in a Global Age (2005), and \n“Jazz in the Global Village” (Jazz Musicological Symposium, University of Music and Dramatic \nArts, Graz, Austria, 2009)—are exemplary studies of jazz in cross-cultural forms, and of jazz \nintersecting with local identities around the world. For example, in his book chapter “Fusion \nand Crossovers” in The Cambridge Companion to Jazz,37 Nicholson discusses cross-cultural \ncompositions that contain the elements of Swedish traditional music that have been integrated \nwith musical vocabulary of jazz. Nicholson’s prominent examples of crossover compositions \nconsist of the application of bebop influences and swing rhythm to Swedish-style melodies in \nthe 1950s works of Swedish saxophonist Lars Gullin: “Sov Du Lilla Vide Ung” (1952), “Fedja” \n(1956), and “Ma” (1956). Additionally, he notes the recordings of Jan Johansson (a pianist), \n                                                        \n34 Ibid., 50. \n35 Ibid., 105. \n36 In addition to Nicholson’s work, recent jazz studies literature related to the concept of the globalization of jazz \nincludes Jazz Planet (2003) edited by E.

According \nto Nicholson, the music in Garbarek’s Dis (1977) also witnessed the use of a wind harp to \ndescribe the sound of the Scandinavian landscape, which Garbarek then intermingled with his \njazz music vocabulary. Garbarek also provided an interesting statement on blending his musical \nheritage and jazz influences: \n \nYou can apply any personal input coming from whatever part of the world, and it’s possible to find a \nway that will work in the jazz idiom. We have players from any part of the world now doing their own, \nshall we say, native version. They find their own direction, influenced by their own culture, but [are] still \nusing the very strong basic elements of jazz.38  \nDon Ellis’s work provides numerous examples of influence from a wide range of composers \nand traditions. Many of his jazz orchestra compositions were significantly infused with musical \nelements from diverse places, including musical traditions from India, Bulgaria, and Turkey. In \nher 2007 essay “Diversifying the Groove: Bulgarian Folk Meets the Jazz idiom,” Claire Levy \nexplains the strong relationship between Ellis and Milcho Leviev, a Bulgarian jazz pianist who \nassisted Ellis in refining and transposing elements from Bulgarian rural music traditions into \njazz orchestra music. In her essay, Levy also describes the process of making “Bulgarian Bulge,” \na jazz orchestra composition in 33/16 inspired by “Sadovsko Horo,” a Bulgarian dance. Aside \nfrom incorporating additive meters of Bulgarian music into jazz orchestra music, Don Ellis \nalso—according to Sean Felson’s doctoral dissertation on Ellis’s rhythmic approach—\nextensively researched Hindustani music to find alternative approaches to rhythmic concepts \nin jazz.39 For example, Ellis explains “I learned from Harihar Rao how to superimpose \ncomplicated rhythmic patterns on one another, ways of counting to be able to keep my place \n                                                        \n38Quoted in ibid., 242–243.  \n39 Sean Felson, “The Exotic Rhythm of Don Ellis,” PhD Diss., Johns Hopkins University (2002). \n",

Additionally, in his doctoral thesis on the Sydney Jazz Scene, Rose \nprovides a comprehensive investigation into what he considers the authenticity of the \n“Australian sound” through an intensive discussion of several Australian and American jazz \nwriters and critics, among them the prominent Australian jazz scholars Bruce Johnson and \nJohn Whiteoak.43 In addition, Rose interviews multiple prominent Australian jazz performers \nand university lecturers such as saxophonist Sandy Evans, trumpet player Phillip Slater, and \ndrummer Simon Barker, focusing on their assessments of the aesthetics of Australian jazz \nperformance and improvisation as well as on their musical experiences within the Sydney jazz \nscene.   \nIn his thesis, Rose also discusses the jazz orchestra composition he wrote for his album The \nFatal Shore. The composition narrates the story of Australian convicts—starting from \nimprisonment in labor camps to freedom—by using a musical interpretation of Australian’s \nconvict songs combined with jazz harmonies, blues-oriented pitch bending, and modal jazz. \nRose also integrates additional musical elements that he refers to as “non-Western material,” \n                                                        \n40 Ibid., 25. \n41 Gary Andrew Fienberg, “It doesn’t have to be Sanctified to Swing: A Biography of Don Ellis,” PhD Diss., \nUniversity of Pittsburgh (2004). \n42 Ibid., 145–146. \n43 Jeremy Rose, “Deeper Shade of Blue: A Case Study of Five Compositions Informed by Ethno-musicological \nInvestigation of the Sydney Jazz Scene,” PhD diss., University of Sydney (2015), 15-16. \n",

Other \ncompositional techniques mentioned in Rose’s compositional analysis chapter include the use \nof the harpsichord to depict the movement of convicts from Georgian England to Australian \nlabor camps, the use of aleatoric methods, in which he gives the players a pitch collection or a \ntone row and lets them choose a sound from their own decisions, and the utilization of \n“number diamonds,” a technique developed by Greg Sheehan, an Australian composer. To \napply Sheehan’s compositional technique, Rose created a number sequence in which the last \nnumber of a series is moved up one step, and backward in the series, to build new variations.44 \nIn addition, Rose also states in his research that the compositions in this album were partly \ninfluenced by Wynton Marsalis’s oratorio for jazz orchestra and vocalists Blood on the Fields \n(1997), which Rose suggests may have also been motivated by Robert Hughes’ book, The Fatal \nShore.45 \n2.3 A CASE STUDY OF CROSS-CULTURAL JAZZ PROJECTS IN ASIA \n \n“I’m trying to draw from my heritage and enrich the jazz tradition without changing it. I’m \nputting into jazz, not just taking out” said Japanese American jazz pianist and composer \nToshiko Akiyoshi.46 In his essay on Akiyoshi, Kevin Fellezs provides her biography and \nexplicitly illustrates her artistic opinions on her cross-cultural compositions. Beginning with a \ndiscussion of Akiyoshi’s original compositions, “Long Yellow Road” (1961), “Kogun” (1974), \n“Village” (1976), and “Deracinated Flower” (1977), Fellezs illustrates the initial processes \nevident in Akiyoshi’s works, in which she blends Japanese aesthetics with musical elements of \njazz, such as Brazilian samba rhythms, swing, and Afro-Cuban rhythms. \nFellezs’s essay then demonstrates Akiyoshi’s use of traditional Japanese instruments in her \nmusic between 1970 and 1980, including the tsuzumi (hand drum), shakuhachi (a bamboo \nrecorder), hyōshigi (wood clap), and koto (a zither-type instrument). The author also provides \ninsight into Akiyoshi’s personal perspectives on using traditional instruments in jazz orchestra \nmusic, with the composer explaining: “If you are infusing something into the music, a different \nelement, it should become richer—that’s the important part. If you infuse an element and it \n                                                        \n44 See ibid., 99, for a detailed description of number diamonds. \n45 Ibid., 72-73. \n46 Kevin Fellezs, “Deracinated Flower: Toshiko Akiyoshi’s “Trace in Jazz History,” Jazz Perspectives 4 no.1 (2010), \n35. \n",

In this interview, \nAkiyoshi also shares how she began to utilize trumpets to interpret the sound of gagaku \nperformances—a process that required a distinct bending technique. Regarding the trumpet \nplayers’ first attempts to interpret the sound of gagaku, Akiyoshi noted, “[The] first time we \nrehearsed, the trumpet players were saying, ‘we can’t bend the notes.’ I said, ‘oh yes you can, \nbecause I’ve seen Japanese trumpet players do it, so if [the] Japanese can do it, you can do \nit’.”48  \nDavid W. Stowe offers additional perspectives on Akiyoshi’s large-scale compositions. Two of \nher multi-movement suites, Minamata (1976) and Kourakan Suite (1992), witness the \ncombination of utai (a specific noh musical technique) with the bebop language and collective \nimprovisation.49 Interestingly, Stowe refers to Kourakan Suite as a demonstration of Japanese \ncultural pluralism. In this composition, Akiyoshi employed several musical elements that come \nfrom “non-Japanese traditions.” These musical elements include the adaptation of an Arabic \nmelody during the introduction in 6/4 meter and the use of Tibetan instruments—specifically, \nthe gsil snyan (a pair of large cymbals) and the dung chen (long metal trumpets)—which have been \nintegrated with a shuffle feel and harmonies in a style reminiscent of Duke Ellington’s music. \nAkiyoshi also commented on the practice of pluralism within this composition, explaining, “we \nfound out that migrations to Japan had come not only from Korea and China but also from \nfar away, from the Near East, the silk roads… and this showed we have so many different \npeople… not really Japanese, not really American, and not really Near Eastern.”50  \n                                                        \n47 Ibid., 36. \n48 Anthony Brown, “Toshiko Akiyoshi NEA Jazz Master 2007”, the Smithsonian Jazz Oral History Program, \n<https://amhistory.si.edu/jazz/Akiyoshi-Toshiko/Toshiko_Akiyoshi_Transcript.pdf> (29 June 2008). \n49 David W.

In their musical analyses, the authors highlight the group’s hybrid musical \nprocesses, which include the deployment of local tunings for Western instruments to imitate \nthe idioms of traditional Sundanese instruments, the use of bonang, a Javanese gong chime, to \nperform in particular musical contexts that are not synonymous with the instrument, and the \napplication of improvisations by traditional instruments—such as the bonang, rebab, suling, and \ntarompet—over Western harmonic chord progressions.  \nIn terms of Krakatau’s artistic process, the authors highlight that Krakatau’s music, according \nto Dharmawan, is the result of “acculturation” (akulturasi) between musicians from two \ndifferent backgrounds: those who studied Western music and those who studied karawitan \ngamelan (the science or intricacy of the gamelan). However, Dharmawan also explicitly states in \nHarnish and Wallach’s article that Krakatau does not perform “traditional music,” which may \ncontribute to the restriction of certain performance techniques. Interestingly, Harnish and \nWallach also point out how Krakatau’s contemporary approach sets the group apart from other \ngamelan jazz ensembles: \nKrakatau did fusion in reverse. While many of the American artists the Indonesian group emulates \nblended pop elements into their work to gain greater commercial appeal, the musicians of Krakatau have \nsacrificed popularity by incorporating more traditional music into their established pop-jazz sound.52 \n \n2.4 A SURVEY OF CROSS-CULTURAL COMPOSITION STUDIES IN \nTHAILAND \n \nHistorical documents suggest that the initial cross-cultural blend of traditional Thai music and \nmusic from Europe most likely occurred after the appearance of Catholic missionaries in the \nsixteenth century during the Ayutthaya period (1350–1767).

Pamala Moro also mentions the historical evidence of contact between European \nvisitors—in particular, Portuguese envoys and French missionaries––and locals. 54  The most \nimportant musical evidence Moro presents is a travel document written in 1687 by French \nmissionary Simon de la Loubere. In this document, de la Loubere describes the structure of a \nThai two-headed drum shaped like a small barrel55 and mentions Thai vocal music. In addition, \nde la Loubere’s chronicle includes his attempt to transcribe what he calls a Siamese melody into \nWestern notation. This transcription is possibly the first manuscript of Thai music notated by \na Western explorer, and a portion of this melody ended up as one of several sources of the \nThai royal anthem, which was composed in the late nineteenth century.56 \n \nJittapim Yamprai demonstrates the initial influences of cross-cultural hybrids between jazz and \ntraditional Thai music—a widespread phenomenon due to the influence of Pradit Sukhum \n(1904–1967), a multi-instrumentalist who was credited with forming the first Thai-jazz \nensemble during the 1930s.57 Yamprai’s research also refers to Eua Sunthornsana, a violinist, \nsinger, and composer who was one of Pradit Sukhum’s pupils and a founder of the \nSuntaraporn Band, which would become one of the primary groups in the Thai urban music \nscene in the 1940s and 1950s, and would later disseminate a new type of cross-cultural \ncollaboration in the form of a new musical genre known as Phleng Luk Krung (a type of Thai \npopular music that promoted the urban lifestyle).58 In addition, Sunthornsana also played a \ncrucial role in establishing one of the prominent Thai cross-cultural ensembles with M.L.

She also \nemphasizes that the decrees of the Cultural Revolution under Phibulsongkhram’s government \nhad a dramatic effect on the Thai music scene. Performances of traditional Thai music tended \nto be overlooked, and the demand for Western ensembles to accompany Western dance styles \nincreased significantly.62 As a result, cross-cultural musical compositions that adopted the \ncharacteristics of traditional Thai music and Western harmonies and rhythms—such as swing, \nfoxtrots, and ballads—flourished and were disseminated to the Thai middle class; this music \nbecame widespread in many ballrooms in Bangkok. As mentioned earlier, one prominent \nmusical ensemble was also Eua Sunthornsana’s band, Suntaraporn—the ensemble of the Thai \nPublic Relations Department. Terry E. Miller also discusses a related Thai performance style \ncalled ramwong mattrathan63 which was a result of the Cultural Revolution. He describes ramwong \nmattrathan performance as “a circular social dance, using Thai-derived gestures of the hands, \naccompanied by Westernized Thai music.”64 \nJohn Garzoli’s writings have also approached cross-cultural Thai compositional perspectives.65 \nHis 2014 article on Thai fusion music highlights the Thai artistic attitudes towards the degree \nof cross-cultural pollination—for example, Thai vs. Western perspectives—providing an \nextensive discussion of the Thai tuning system and its dissimilarity to equal temperament, and \n                                                        \n59 See, Poonpit Amatayakul, “Phleng Snagkhet Samphan Vol.152” Thai Music in the Past Sirindhorn Music Library< \nhttps://sirindhornmusiclibrary.li.mahidol.ac.th/thai_contemporary_mu/plengthaisakol-152/> (n.d.). \n60 As cited in Anant Narkkong, Thai Contemporary Music Bands and Works in present Thai society (the Office of \nContemporary Art and Culture, Ministry of Culture, 2013), 32. \n61 Deborah Wong, Sounding the center: History and Aesthetic in Thai Buddhist Performance, (Chicago: The University of \nChicago Press, 2001) \n62 Ibid.,189-191. \n63 To find an example of Ramwong music, please see the Suntaraporn band’s album Ramwong Matratarn.  \n64.

For \nexample, in the case of the Khun In Off Beat Siam ensemble, Garzoli illustrates the group’s \nadaptation of contemporary rhythms from styles such as rock and funk, as well as their use of \nfunctional Western music harmonies with the piano, guitar, and bass. They use these harmonies \nto accompany the Thai melodies—such as “Homrong Jin Dok Mai,” which is performed by \nthe ranad ek (a Thai xylophone)—and Thai instrumental idioms, including the ti kep67 and rua68 \ntechniques in thang ranat and contribute to the distinctly Thai sound. \nGarzoli also discusses Fong Namm, one of the prominent cross-cultural ensembles in \nThailand. He discusses the compositional and performance approaches of Bruce Gaston, a co-\nfounder of the group, and an American composer who studied with a highly respected \ntraditional Thai musician and a national artist, Bunyong Ketkhong.69 Unlike other fusion bands \nfrom the same period, the compositional approaches of Fong Namm tend to follow the logical \nprocesses of Thai composition and performance. The group has referred to this approach as \nputting “Thai musical principles over Western [ones]” and the “Thai way of doing things rather \nthan the Western [way].”70 As a consequence, the core music of Fong Namm has primarily \ncomprised elements of Thai music surrounded by Western musical elements. Garzoli analyses \nthree of Fong Namm’s compositions—“Ahnu,” “Chao Phraya Concerto,” and “Rabam Chao \nRai”—highlighting their adaptation of Thai heterophonic music textures, Thai musical forms, \nthe Thai classical music extended form called thao, and their imitation of Thai instrumental \nidioms by Western instruments—indicating the band’s ability to integrate their sound with the \ncomplexity of contemporary Western compositional approaches. \nSimilar to the experimental compositional approaches employed by Bruce Gaston are the \nworks of Thai composer, Jiradej Setabundhu. In his PhD dissertation, Setabundhu discusses \nhis cross-cultural integration of contemporary Western classical compositional approaches into \n                                                        \n66 Garzoli, Intonational, Idiomatic, and Historical Factors That Shape Contemporary Thai Fusion Music, 167-171. \n67 An instrumental technique that uses a set of eighth notes to construct melodic lines depending on the original \ncomposition’s target pitches. \n68 A single melodic pitch tremolo. \n69 Also Romanized as Boonyong Ketkhong. \n70 Ibid., 249. \n",

Thereafter, Setabundhu explains how in “Façade,” and “In Smoky Speculation,” he \nuses a musical form based on thao,72 in pieces written for Western instruments. Perhaps more \ninteresting is how, in “Eine schöne Zeit war es,” he transforms the Thai sound in a non-\nrepresentational way. In this composition, Setabundhu structures the music on the concept of \ncentonization—a hierarchical pitch system that he recognizes as a structural core of Thai \nmusic. He applies this system to a set of musical pitches that he personally interpreted from \neach word in a letter written by the painter Wassily Kandinsky to Arnold Schoenberg in 1993. \nSetabundhu took these pitches and constructed his composition through centonization, rather \nthan through a framework such as Schoenberg’s serialism. About the compositional structure \nof “Eine schöne Zeit war es” Setabundhu remarked: “the piece does not sound similar to Thai \nmusic but is based on a very similar structural system.”73  \nTwo other key Thai composers who have successfully worked on cross-cultural compositions \nare Narongrit Dhamabutra and Narong Prangcharoen, both of whom are extensively discussed \nin Nathinee Chucherdwatanasak’s writing. Chucherdwatanasak describes the works of \nDhamabutra as converting Thai sonority through Western instruments—as opposed to the \nexploration of complex Thai musical structures and experimentalism displayed in the music of \nBruce Gaston or Jiradej Setabundhu. Chucherdwatanasak explains that the compositional \napproaches of Dhamabutra predominantly consist of using Thai pentatonic melodies, \nimitating the sound of Thai instruments, and employing compositional techniques from the \nNeo-Romantic period—which plays a crucial role in Dhamabutra’s compositional aspects. For \nexample, in “Sinfonia Suvarnabhumi” (2005), Dhamabutra composed new thematic melodies \ninspired by the traditional music of Thai royal barge processions, transforming the sounds of \n                                                        \n71 Jiradej Setabundhu, “Aspects of Thai Music and Compositional Techniques in Selected Works of Jiradej \nSetabundhu,” PhD diss., Northwestern University (2001). \n72 An extended musical form in Thai classical music which consists of three movements and utilizes the \naugmentation and diminution compositional techniques.

Similar to the works of Dhamabutra, Prangcharoen’s cross-\ncultural compositional projects predominantly focus on featuring Thai musical elements in \norchestral pieces; however, the works of Prangcharoen focus more on incorporating harmonic \ndissonance and elements of atonality. Pawatchai Suwankangka provides a comprehensive \ndiscussion of Prangcharoen’s compositional process. For example, in Prangcharoen’s piece \nThree Minds, the three movements—“Fierce,” “Absent,” and “Hesitant”—were inspired by \nPrangcharoen’s Buddhism.75  In these three movements, the music is significantly influenced \nby idiomatic Thai instrumental techniques—namely, sabat (a set of three grace notes) and kro \n(two-pitch tremolo)—which were played by a ranad (a wooden xylophone).  \n \nUnlike other cross-cultural Thai classical composers, Prangcharoen’s compositional aspects \nnever fully adhere to the Thai musical tradition, with the composer preferring to take Thai \nmusical elements and adapt them to his personal creative style. For example, in Prangcharoen’s \ninterview with Bangkokbiznews.com, the composer provides an insight into his compositional \nperspective:  \n \nNowadays, I don’t think there is one hundred percent Thai [music], we are all affected by the concept \nof globalization, and we have been influenced by many different cultures around us… And, for me, the \nmost important work on cross-cultural compositions is to find your own way to interpret Thai aspects \nin your music, and avoid following other composer’s footpaths.76 \n \nDespite the abundance of contemporary studies on Thai cross-cultural projects, there remains \na dearth of research on cross-cultural Thai jazz music, particularly from contemporary jazz \nperspectives. One explanation for this could be that the comprehensive jazz studies program \nis still relatively new, with the first jazz studies program in Thailand only being established in \n1998, as mentioned earlier. However, the demand for using jazz as a musical tool and infusing \nit with elements of Thai music has considerably increased, and the works of Thai cross-cultural \ncontemporary jazz artists can be regularly experienced within the Thai music scene.

Roongruang also illustrates how musicians can use Western notation to write Thai \nmusic, using examples such as meter adjustment, displaying the typical range of Thai \ninstruments in staff notation, as well as using luk tok (target pitches) to indicate Thai melodic \nphrases. The author also highlights potential problems which may occur when using staff \nnotation to notate Thai music. Importantly, Roongruang’s research has also provided an \nextensive overview of the Thai manuscript collection published by the Thai Music Manuscript \nCommittee between 1936 and 1942, which include transcriptions in Western notation, useful \nfor composers in jazz and other Western-notated traditions in the study of Thai music.78 \n \nAnant Narkkong contributes a clarification of rhythmic concepts in Thai classical music, as \nwell as a comprehensive discussion on how Thai classical percussion instruments are \n                                                        \n77 Panya Roongruang, “Thai Classical Music Its Movement from Oral to Written Transmission, 1930-1942: \nHistorical Context, Method, and Legacy of the Thai music Manuscript Project,” PhD diss., Kent State University \n(1999). \n78 Ibid. 229-250. \n",

The \nauthor then demonstrates proper methods for notating Thai rhythmic patterns in Western \nnotation and offers the example of drum stroke patterns employed in Thai repertories, \nincluding discussions of pieces such as “Si Nuan” and “Khaek Borrathet.”  \n \nSomnuek Saengarun also provides significant insight into how Thai classical musicians \ncompose music. 80 In his thesis, Saengarun investigates the compositional methods of Lt. Col \nSanoh Luangsuntorn, a prominent Thai classical musician. These compositional techniques, \ninclude—to name a few—the application of independent luk khong (fundamental melodic \nlines), the utilization of particular patterns of luk tok (target pitches) from existing compositions \nto create new compositions, the diminution and extension of original compositions to create \nnew pieces, melodic variations and embellishments, the application of diminutions and \nextensions combined with melodic variations, the utilization of sustained Thai pitches (luk \nthao), and the adaptation of foreign music accents81 (e.g., Khmer, Lao, Mon, and Chinese \naccents) to create new Thai melodic lines.

His dissertation illustrates the improvisation process of \nthe use of five basic modes called lai used in performance on the kaen (usually Romanized as \nkhaen)—a bamboo mouth organ—and then describes the various styles used in a northeastern \nform of song called mawlum (sometimes Romanized as mor lam, and, e.g., mawlum glawn, mawlum \nruang, mawlum phi fah) and its application in performances.

Jazz writers and critics \nhave approached this phenomenon in a variety of ways with some, like Stuart Nicholson, \nreferring to the movement as the globalization of jazz and the adaptation of jazz to local \nmusical traditions to the ends of establishing artistic identities or suiting local audience \nexperiences. Some European jazz musicians applied their own musical traditions and \nmanipulated folk melodies to create their cross-cultural music composition. These crossover \nprocesses include examples such as the application of bulerías, a flamenco rhythm, into blues \nby Chano Domínguez; the Swedish-folk-inspired music of Swedish jazz musicians Lars Gullin \nand Jan Johansson; and the integration of jazz musical elements into the convict songs of \nEuropean Australians of Jeremy Rose, an Australian jazz saxophonist, all of which can offer \ndistinctive jazz composing methods. \n                                                        \n93 Lawrence N.

However, several artistic experiences, such as Miles Davis’s comments \nabout the difficulty of using the trumpet to mimic flamenco singing, or Toshiko’s remark about \nher trumpet player who asserts it is impossible to replicate Japanese musical techniques on his \ninstrument, highlight the difficulty of the process of cross-cultural music-making. Importantly, \nthe conflict between conservative and progressive viewpoints in previous cross-cultural music \nprojects can be seen in works of flamenco jazz and gamelan-inspired jazz. Rodriguez’s research \nand the comment of Indonesia’s Krakatau ensemble also suggest that rather than being \nconcerned with traditional aspects, their compositional approach appears to be focused on \ncreativity.  \n \nSimilarly, influences of crossovers between jazz and Thai traditional music had been present \nsince the arrival of the Suntaraporn Band in the Thai music scene between the 1940s and the \n1950s. Later on, Eua Sunthornsana, the band leader of Suntaraporn, also played a significant \nrole in the origin of the Snagkhet Samphan ensemble, one of the prominent cross-cultural \nmusic ensembles, in which the utilization of the Thai Mahori ensemble and traditional Thai \nrepertoires mainly in Thai classical music was similarly integrated into a big band. John Garzoli \npresents the case of Thai fusion ensembles, which were somewhat associated with the musical \nelements of jazz. He discusses the example of Bruce Gaston, a cofounder of Fong Namm, and \nhis compositional techniques, emphasized that Gastons’s approach was heavily influenced by \nthe Thai way of thinking rather than the Western manner. \nOther cross-cultural works in Thai music can also be observed from a contemporary classical \ncomposer such as Jiradej Setabundhu, Narongrit Dhamabutra, and Narong Prangcharoen. The \ncross-cultural works of Setabundhu, and Prangcharoen tend to be infused with Thai elements \nin superimposed methods, whilst Dhamabutra’s approaches took concept of the Neo-\nRomanticism infused with Thai music. Prangcharoen also himself remarked on the purity of \nThai music, which he believed there is no one hundred percent Thainess anymore due to \nglobalization’s effect.  \nIn conclusion, the selected literature, documents, and dissertations discussed from section 2.2 \nto section 2.4 provide vital information for a cross-cultural jazz composer.

These kingdoms, such as Sukhothai, Lavo, \nand Suphannaphum, all of which absorbed Mon-Khmer influence and began to mingle a \n“Tai”97 language to communicate. The kingdom of Ayutthaya arose in the mid-fourteenth \ncentury, centered on a city of the same name, and incorporating some of these kingdoms by \nmilitary actions and royal intermarriages. Ayutthaya was often call “Siam”98 by outsiders, and \nexisted between 1351 and 1769. It is considered the precursor to present-day Thailand, and its \nethnic diversity reveals much about the diverse cultural practices of Thailand today, including \nmusical ones. \nCreated by a merging of the Suphannaphum and Sukhothai dynasties and absorbing the \nprevious states under Mon-Khmer influence including Lavo,99 the cosmopolitan kingdom of \nAyutthaya was an ethnically diverse city-state that was politically and religiously influenced by \nthe ancient Mon-Khmer kingdoms. It also adopted the language, cultures, and aesthetics of the \nTai speakers who lived in the north and northeast areas within the kingdom.100 The political \nreach of the Ayutthaya kingdom extended throughout of Southeast Asia, from the northeast \nin present-day Thailand (where its dominance reached Nakhon Ratchasima), to the north in \nPhitsanulok and Sukhothai, to the west in Dawei (ทวาย)(present-day Myanmar), and to the south \n                                                        \n97 The Tai language, which is now known as the “Thai” language, is a member of the ‘Tai-Kadai” language family. \nIt was also used alongside Khmer, Mon, and Sankrit in the past, all of which had a significant influence on the \nThai language of today.

The \nChevalier de Chaumont, the French ambassador to the court of the Siamese Kingdom during \nthis period, stated, “there is no city in the East where [are] seen more different nations than in \nthe capital city of Siam, and where so many different tongues are spoken.”102 Chris Baker and \nPasuk Phongpaichit describe the contextual factors that contributed to the cultural diversity of \nthe Ayutthaya Kingdom and its cosmopolitan society, writing, \n[The] Portuguese first arrived as soldiers of fortune in the early sixteenth century, and their numbers \nswelled when the Portuguese community was expelled from Macassar in 1668. Over the years, the \nPortuguese intermarried with other Christians, particularly those from Japan and southern India. By the \nseventeenth century, the mestizo community numbered around five to six thousand, occupied in petty \ntrading and service. A community of “Moors,” meaning “Turks, Persians, Golcondans, and those of \nBengal,” had been present since the heyday of mercenaries in the early sixteenth century, and still \nsupplied soldiers and guards throughout the seventeenth, while others worked as sailors, sugar palm \ngrowers, weavers, binders, and dyers. Persian trader-officials flocked to the city in the early Narai reign, \nand though the numbers dropped after the fall of Aqa Muhammed Astarabadi in the mid-1670s, some \nthree to four thousand remained a decade later.103  \nAnthropologist Pamala Moro discusses musical aspects in historical documentation of Thai \nmusic since the sixteenth century. She explicitly summarizes the substantial historical records \nof contact between the people of the Siamese Kingdom and Europeans during the dominance \nof Ayutthaya, and points out that the first arrival of Westerners is most likely to have been the \ngroup of Portuguese envoys led by Duarte Fernandez in 1516.104 After Fernandez’s voyage, the \nnumber of foreigners who visited Ayutthaya gradually increased—particularly in the numbers \nof French missionaries who aimed to convert the kingdom into a realm of Christianity during \nthe eighteenth century. Moro also states that two of the fifty-nine extant sources written by \nthese European travelers in the sixteenth century provide details and references of a musical \nnature.105 \n                                                        \n101 Ibid., 32. \n102  Baker and Phongpaichit, A History of Ayutthaya: Siam in the Early Modern World, 203. \n103 Ibid., 204. \n104 Moro, “Thai music and Musicians in Contemporary: An ethnography,”39-40.   \n105 Ibid., 39. \n",

The most \nsignificant musical evidence from this period is perhaps a travelogue written by the French \ndiplomat Simon de la Loubere in 1687. In addition to the illustration of the Thai drum (shaped \nlike a small barrel) as previously described in Chapter 2, this document highlighted the use of \na duple meter in Thai vocal music, and included the author’s transcription of a Siamese melody \ninto Western notation, under the title A Siamese Song (Sai Samon).106 This transcription is \ncredited as the first musical document of Thai music notated by a foreigner, and a portion of \nthe song’s melody was included in the royal anthem that was created in the nineteenth \ncentury.107  \nMUSICAL TRANSCULTURATION \nThe social, cultural, and ethnic diversity in the Siamese Kingdom created an openness to \nforeign influences from the Siamese perspective. As a result, diverse philosophies, religious \nbeliefs, technologies, and cultures were widely exchanged in this region. The non-\ndiscriminatory musical practices of Siamese music were no exception—the use of foreign \ninstruments by musicians in the Siamese Kingdom was particularly common. As Sujit \nWongthes, a Thai journalist and well-known historian explains:  \nThe culture of using Bamboo to manufacture instruments is one of the common cultures that can be \nexchanged in the Southeast Asian mainland. For example, ‘khaen’, a traditional instrument of Laotian \nand northeastern Thailand was also employed for performances in Siamese Courts in the Ayutthaya \nperiod.108  \nOther musical instruments that were introduced by foreigners and employed in Thai classical \nmusic ensembles also included the saw duang and saw u, both two-stringed bowed fiddles that \nwere adopted from Chinese instruments. Terry Miller suggests that these traditional fiddles \nseem to have a deep relationship with the Chaozhou Chinese instrument called erxian which is \ntypically employed in Cantonese music.109  \n                                                        \n106 For further explanation of “Sai Samon” is provided by La Loubère, Simon de, 1642-1729.

According to David Morton, these \nmusical instruments and the production of such instruments also transferred to the Siamese \nKingdom, via the cultural influence of the Khmer Empire. Many twelfth- and thirteenth-\ncentury illustrations of musicians and ritual ceremonies depict sets of kettle gongs that have a \npartly similar structure to the musical instruments of Siamese court music, which can also be \nseen at multiple archaeological sites in Angkor Wat and in Central Java.110 Thai historian Danit \nYupho also states multiple percussion instruments used in Thai classical music such as the \ntaphon (double-headed barrel-shaped drum) and rammana (frame drum) also came from India \nand other cultures in the Malay Peninsula, respectively.111   \nWhile these traditional instruments explicitly originated abroad and remarkably influenced the \ntraditional music practices of Siamese cultures, musicians in the Siamese Kingdom began to \ndevelop their own characteristics in order to suit the aesthetic tastes of its people, with \nmusicians starting to create their own unique techniques—unrelated to the original cultures—\nto perform on these instruments. As David Morton explains:  \nThe mainstream of Thai traditional music as it is known today is probably a composite of musical \nelements from several cultures. Thai music itself [consists of] influences from Chinese, Indian, and \nKhmer (Cambodian music). Musical elements from other neighboring cultures, Burma, and Malay, for \nexample were possibly also absorbed into the evolving Thai traditional style. Characteristically the \nassimilated elements were incorporated in the existing culture of the Thai to suit their own taste, resulting \nin a culture distinct from those from which these elements were originally acquired.112 \nPhilip Cornwel-Smith has also proposed a critical process in Thai cultures that results in \ntransformation and adaptation, arguing that absorbing foreign influences is unavoidable for \nThai people. He states: \n \nMaking imports Thai is actually an old tradition. While all nationalities absorb outside influences, Thai \nhave retained their distinctiveness and independence despite living at a crossroads of cultures: Chinese, \nIndian, Western, Japanese, Khmer, Burmese, Malay, and indigenous tribes. The customization of \nimports is key to that elusive, immutable Thainess, since the essence lies not in invention, but \ntransformation. Anything, given time enough to steep here, can end up very Thai.113   \nThe example of foreign musical instruments in Thai music provides an example of the broader \nconcept of how Thainess develops out of cultural diversity, and helps explain why the people \n                                                        \n110 David Morton, The Traditional Music of Thailand (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976), 5-7. \n111 Danit Yuhpho, Thai Musical instrument and Thai Musical ensemble (Bangkok: The Fine Arts Department, 1987), \n34. \n112 Ibid.,1. \n113 Miller, “Appropriating the Exotic: Thai Music and the Adoption of Chinese Elements,” 113. \n",

Most \nsignificantly, the practice of transculturation in Thailand is a result of the great ethnic diversity \nand origins of the Siamese Kingdom in the past. It is also likely related to its location in the \ncenter of mainland Southeast Asia. As a result, this condition contributed significantly to \nprevious cultural exchange activities.114  \nTHE MODERN THAI NATION \nAfter the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, the Siamese state was reestablished and declared \nindependent by King Taksin (1767-1782), who was then followed by King Phutthayotfa (1782–\n1809). King Phutthayotfa was the founder of the Chakri Dynasty (1782–present), which \nmarked the beginning of the new era known as the Rattanakosin period (1782–1932). During \nthis time, the Siamese court was relocated to Bangkok, and military actions largely pushed the \nmigration of other ethnic groups into Siamese territory. Notable displacements in this period \nincluded the resettlement of Laos, Phu thai, Tai Dam, and Puan (พวน)—to name a few—all of \nwhich took place during King Rama III’s reign (1809-1824).115 These groups of people were \nforced to relocate from the east bank of the Mekong River to live in the area of present-day \nnortheast Thailand, in towns such as Kalasin, Nong Khai, Nakhon Phanom, and Sankon \nNakoh. This resettlement led to significant transculturation in northeast Thailand and \ncontributed to the construction of traditional northeast Thai music, and to the broader diversity \nof traditional music in Thailand.   \nIt was also during the period of the Chakri Dynasty, during the reign of King Chulalongkorn \n(or King Rama V, as he was known by most Thai) (1868-1910), that the concept of “one \nnation” became firmly established and the ideology of nationalism began to be promoted.116 \nOne of the main factors in the introduction of such ideology was the immense influence of \ncolonialism from Western countries on the Siamese court. During his reign King \nChulalongkorn began to reform the procedures on how the court governed satellite states near, \n                                                        \n114 Transculturation is a concept that introduced by Fernando Ortiz. James Lull, the author of Media, \nCommunication, culture: A Global Approach. (2000), further explains that the concept of transculturation is a process \nwhereby cultural forms literally move through time and space, where they interact with other cultural forms and \nsettings, influence each other, produce new forms, and change the cultural setting. \n115 Wyatt, Thailand: A Short History, 156. \n116 “Those many countries which have been formed into nations and countries uphold that the history of one’s \nnation and country is an important matter to be known clearly and accurately through study and teaching.

These states, for example, Lanna in the north and \nPattani in the south, were gradually forced to merge into Siamese territory and began to lose \ntheir autonomy to govern themselves. Similar to the northeast resettlement, the ethnicities and \ncultural practices of the people of Lanna and Pattani were widely diverse and dissimilar to the \nsocial and cultural practices of the Siamese court. This territorial annexation of the two regions \nalso resulted in distinctive music traditions, which were later recognized as the traditional music \nof northern and southern Thailand.117   \nAnother important factor that reshaped the society, culture, and ultimately the borders of \nmodern Thailand was the loss of territory of the Siamese Kingdom between 1785 and 1909. \nAccording to David Wyatt, seven incidents of the Siam territorial losses include:118 \n1) Cession to Britain by the Sultan of Kedah, 1785-1909.  \n2) Cambodian territory placed under French protection by Franco-Siamese Treaty, 1876. \n3) Black Tai territory taken by France, 1888. \n4) East Bank of Mekong ceded to France by Franco-Siamese Treaty, 1893. \n5) West Bank of Mekong ceded to France by Franco-Siamese Treaty, 1904. \n6) Western Cambodian provinces ceded to France by Franco-Siamese Treaty, 1907. \n7) Malay states ceded to Britain by Anglo-Siamese Treaty, 1909. \nAfter these losses, the border of the Siamese Kingdom took that shape of the borders of \npresent-day Thailand. Following the Siamese revolution in 1932, the country’s name was \nchanged under the government of Prime Minister Plaek Phibulsongkhram from Siam to \nThailand in 1939.119  \nThese histories of ethnic diversity in what is now Thailand have profoundly shaped the \nprominent traditional music practices of the nation today. These practices can be generally \ndivided geographically into four distinct regions:  \n1) the musical practices of the center of Thailand or Thai classical music, which have \nbeen fundamentally influenced by Mon, Indian, Khmer, and Chinese traditions;  \n                                                        \n117 For more see, “Siam’s plan to seize Lanna,” a historical seminar by Nuaon Khrouthongkhieo, Faculty of \nHumanities and Social Sciences Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, Bangkok, ThailandMatichon TV \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j-aDZ7gmRw> (27 July 2019). \n118  Wyatt, Thailand: A Short History, 193. \n119 Amornrat Bunnag, Rossarin Soottipong Gray, and Peter Xeno, “Toward an Historical Demography of \nThailand,” Journal of Population and Social Studies 20, no.2 (2012), 100. \n",

In Chapters 4, 5, and 6, I discuss musical traditions of the other three \nregions. \n3.3 THAI CLASSICAL MUSIC (DONTRI THAI DOEM) \n \n \nUnlike flamenco, tango, or Bulgarian folk music, canonical musical practices in Thai classical \nmusic—emerging from central Thailand, where this music was historically practiced by the \nSiamese court—are quite distinct from Western music practices. In particular, and of interest \nfor this study, Thai classical music differs from Western music in its tuning systems and musical \ntextures. When I began my research into Thai classical music for this jazz composition project, \nI sought to understand how the music works based on the perspectives of Thai musicians. \nLater on, I transferred what I acquired from Thai classical music into Western musical \nterminology in order to explain these findings in a manner that jazz composers can \ncomprehend. \n \nPITCH AND THAI MELODIC PATTERNS \n \nThe fundamental principles of pitch production in Thai music can be divided into two \ncategories: 1) a system of seven distinct pitches within one octave produced by melodic \npercussion idiophones, namely, ranad 120 and khong wong 121; and 2) the musical pitches that are \nperformed beyond the seven distinct pitches, and are generated by fretless bowed string \n                                                        \n120 Ranad is a Thai musical instrument, that has a shape similar to a xylophone in Western music. The Ranad family \nincludes four instruments: ranad ek, ranad thum, ranad ek hlek (ระนาดเอกเหล็ก) and ranad thum hlek. The ranad ek \n(predominated instrument) and ranad ek hlek (metallophone) can produce seven distinct sounds within three \noctaves. As for ranad thum and ranad thum lek (metallophone), it has a larger structure and is capable of producing \na lower sound compared to ranad-ek (i.e. seven distinct pitches within two-octave).  \n121 The Khong is a gong-type instrument used in Thai classical ensembles, with gongs arranged in a curve or circle; \nthe three types consist of khong wong yai, khong wong lek, and khong mon, and are capable of producing seven pitches \n(without chromatic notes) within the range of two octaves. (Note: some of these pitches can go beyond two \noctaves, but are incapable of being completed within three octaves).  \n",

Ellis in 1885.124 However, this concept is considered to be controversial and impractical from \nthe perspectives of multiple Thai music experts and ethnomusicologists. Among such \ndissenting opinions is one provided by John Garzoli, who writes that: \n \nThe contention that Thai music is based on an equidistant tuning system should be abandoned because \nequidistance as specified by the accepted theory of Thai tuning (7-tet) does not exist in Thai music. \nAlthough Ellis’s theory of 7-tet prescribes an ideal interval of 171.429 cents, this is not found on actual \ninstruments, and in the course of this study, no tuners endorsed nor adopted the theory in practice. The \ntheoretical formulation incorrectly assumes an octave of 1:2, and the theory overlooks singers and string \nplayers. Unsurprisingly, given these conditions, the theory of equidistance has not been supported by \nempirical research, which has consistently found no evidence of it.125 \n \nEven I myself began to experience uncertainty regarding Thai classical music pitches and \nencountered the dilemma of the 7-tet system when attempting to transcribe multiple Thai \nclassical compositions. However, I have begun to accept and directly perceive that “intonation \ndiversity” is the proper concept that should be applied to the tuning system in Thai classical \nmusic. In my transcription processes, I have found that every Thai classical ensemble has its \nown unique tuning system and employs diverse methods to blend their instrumental pitches \nwhen performing as an ensemble. However, nowadays, as the technology of Thai instrument \nconstruction has continually improved, Thai classical ensembles can now be constructed to \nproduce a sound that is more mathematically “in tune” with regard to the Western tuning \nsystem.126 It is still important to me as a jazz composer (and others who may wish to approach \nThai classical music) to understand and appreciate the concept of intonation diversity. This is \nimportant in collaboration with musicians of Thai classical music, because accounting for \nintonation diversity helps them preserve the sound of Thai classical music and foster their \n                                                        \n122 A family of string instruments in Thai classical music, also known as khruang sai. Both Saw duang and saw u have \ntwo strings and tune in the perfect 5th from a Western musical perspective. The saw sam sai has three strings and \ncan be tuned in the perfect 4th. These three fiddle instruments are fretless and performed in an upright posture.  \n123 When tuning melodic percussion instruments, Thai musicians add or remove heated beeswax and heat particles \n(lead) under the wooden bars or gongs; for string instruments, players tighten or loosen their stings, in a similar \nmanner to Western fiddles. \n124 John Garzoli, “The Myth of Equidistance in Thai Tuning,” Analytical Approaches to World Music 4, no.2 (2015): \n1-2. \n125 Ibid., 23 \n126 When attempting to build Thai instruments that use the Western tuning system (A=440), Thai musicians refer \nto this system as sieng sakon (เสียงสากล). Ranad and khlui (a vertical block flute) are two of the instruments that are \ntypically built adopting the Western tuning system. These two instruments are widely employed in cross-cultural \nensembles such as Thai fusion bands.  \n",

These seven different pitches appear to be dissimilar to the pitches \nof Western major scales, especially when comparing the intervals between the 3rd and 4th scale \ndegrees and between the 7th scale degree and the octave, which is a half-step interval in a \ndiatonic major scale, but much wider in typical Thai tunings. The other scale degrees produced \nby Thai instruments, however, including 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, can produce a sound relatively similar \nto the structure of major (or minor) pentatonic scales from a Western perspective. (Please note \nthat Thai music compositions in the style of Mon called thang mon may employ the entire seven \npitches when composing and performing.)128  \n \nTo make Thai classical music easier to transmit, Thai musicians developed several distinct \nsystems of musical notation that can be applied to a set of these seven pitches. These systems \ninclude numerical or cipher pitch notation, which widely applies to string instruments (the set \nof a number refers to the fingering used for an instrument—for example, 1 refers to a lower-\npitched fingering, and 2, 3, 4 can direct the other successive fingers on that string129, as well as \nthe Thai alphabetical system, which can be employed for various instruments in Thai classical \nmusic ensembles. The Thai alphabet system is widely used among Thai musicians, and these \nset of seven notes are called (ด), (ร), (ม), (ฟ), (ซ), (ล), (ท), respectively, and can be pronounced \nsimilarly to the syllables of the solfege system (do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si or ti) used in Western \nmusic.130 (It is important to remember that “do” or [ด] in Thai music is not equal to the “C” \npitch [A=440] in Western music and rather closer to B♭).

Similar to transcription practices common in jazz, I started by \ntranscribing several sections of Thai compositions that contain memorable melodic lines and \nless complex musical textures. These compositions, “Rabam Sukhothai,” “Soi Sang Dang,” \n“Lao Somdej,” and “Saen Kham Nung,” each of which contains textures featuring lyrical \nmelodies, providing examples of a characteristic Thai sound, which I will explain later. These \nworks are typically employed for entertainment purposes, in contrast to the irregular melody \ntype used in Thai ceremonial music. \n \nAdditionally, because of the intonation diversity of Thai music, the process of selecting \nparticular recordings for this type of transcription is crucial. Most of the Thai ensembles whose \nrecordings I chose for this study have tuning systems that allow them to be transcribed using \nan equal-tempered keyboard. For each composition, for example “Rabam Sukhothai” (Figure \n3.1)131—the musical accompaniment to a traditional Thai dance—I transcribed both the \nmelodic lines of the A and B sections performed by pi-nai (quadruple-reed aerophone), which \nconstitute pitches that can be approximated to the key of G♭ major pentatonic. “Soi Sang \nDang” (Figure 3.2)132 is from a traditional work famously performed in traditional Thai theater \nbased on a narrative poem called Lilit Phra Lo. The thirty measures of melodic motifs in the A \nsection that I have transcribed were played by ranad ek (wooden xylophone). The piece’s \nmelodic patterns approximate the key of B♭ major pentatonic.  \n \n                                                        \n131 Figure 3.1 was transcribed from Ajahn Saman and artists of The Fine Arts Department, “Rabam Sukhothai” \n(0.11-0.39) Thai Fine Art artists Vol.47, Ocean Media.

The melodic parts of the A section \nin this composition were transcribed from the instrumental parts of the sam sai from a live \nperformance by the group of senior Thai musician teachers of Rattanakosin. The final \ncomposition I selected is “Saen Kham Nung” (Figure 3.4),134 a prominent Thai classical music \npiece composed by Luang Pradit Pairoh (Son Silpabanleng)—one of the most respected Thai \nmusical masters. This music was transcribed from the sound of the ranad ek (xylophone-type \nidiophone), approximated in the key of B♭ major. After completing the transcriptions and \nanalyzing them from a jazz perspective, I was able to identify some key characteristics of these \ntypes of lyrical Thai melodies, and compose melodic lines with these characteristics in my own \njazz compositions.135  \n \nBecause each Thai musical ensemble has a unique approach derived from a combination of \ntheir music teacher’s instructions and their own individual artistic perspectives, these four \nrenditions of Thai music compositions are just some of many possible ways of performing \nThai music.

Even jazz composers must acknowledge that these groups of senior Thai \nmusicians have had the greatest impact on classical Thai music education. In addition, I \nconsider the performance of “Saen Kham Nung” by Asdavuth Sagarik, the great-grandson of \nLuang Pradit Pairoh (Sorn Silpabanleng) to be the most authentic rendition, given the direct \nrelationship between the composer and the performer.  \n                                                        \n133 Figure 3.3 was transcribed from “Lao Somdej,” the performance of H.R.H Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn \nand the group of senior Thai musicians’ teachers of Rattanakosin (2.28- 3.08). \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HjLXOMwCeM> uploaded by offstreeyala (27 May 2013). \n134 Figure 3.4 was transcribed from Asdavuth Sagarik’s performance on “Saen Kham Nung” (1.44 - 2.36). \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxQZQO026k> uploaded by Wisetdontree (4 January 2013). \n135 Appendix C.1-C.4 contains the MIDI files for figures 3.1-3.4. \n",

    "69": " \nCHAPTER 3: Identifying Musical Elements of dontri thai doem \n \n \n53 \nInspired by these melodic patterns, I was able to reconstruct these characteristics in my own \ncompositions, to reference these types of Thai lyrical compositions. For example, in my \ncomposition “A Siamese Medley,” I employed the use of several of the melodic patterns, which \nI had identified, including 1) 1 2 3 5, 2) 5 6 1 2 1 6, 3) 3 2 3 2 1 2, 4) 5 6 1 2 1 6, 5) 5 3 2 1 2 3, \nand 6) 1 6 5 3. I drew on these patterns and on syncopated rhythms, a key feature of jazz, \nbefore composing this piece partially based on rhythm changes, one of the more common \nexpressions of AABA form in the jazz repertoire. These melodic patterns play a significant role \nin contributing a sound of Thai music in one of the standard forms used in jazz composition, \nperformance, and improvisation (Figure 3.6).  \n \nOther melodic patterns in a pentatonic scale—including 1 2 3 5, 1 2 3 5 3, 1 3 2 1 6¯, and in \nparticular, 1 2 3 5 6—can also be widely observed in the set of melodic patterns called thang \n(roughly equivalent to modes in Thai music), of which three out of seven modes have a similar \nconstruction resembling pentatonic scales. 137 These modes consist of 1) thang phiang aw lang (G \nA B D E), which is mainly used in theatrical music (lakhon deuk damban)(ละครดึกดําบรรพ์); 2) thang \nphiang aw bon (C D E G A), which is often used in string ensembles; and 3) thang chawa (F G A \nC D), which is used in Thai ensembles when performing with an instrument called the pi chawa \n(quadruple-reed aerophone).138 Consequently, by understanding the use of the particular \npentatonic scales and patterns implemented in Thai classical music, composers can incorporate \ncharacteristics of Thai melodies into a jazz composition, as I demonstrated in my preliminary \ncomposition, “A Siamese Medley.”139  \n \n                                                        \n137 Miller and Williams, The Garland Handbook of Southeast Asian Music, 142. \n138 These modes patterns were derived from Phichit Chaiseri, “A Thai musical analysis,” Due to the intonation \ndiversity in Thai classical music ensembles, these patterns can be transposed to other keys, such as thang phiang \naw lang (F G A C D) or thang phiang aw bon (B♭ C D F G). However, the patterns of these modes are still based \non the 1-2-3-5-6 construction. \n139 See Appendix A.1 for a full lead sheet of this composition \n",

Numerous independent musical voices often constitute textures in Thai \nclassical music, providing an abundance of simultaneous sounds that could be heard as \nharmony, from a Western perspective. Yet even to trained musician ears, it still can be \nchallenging, in the context of some of these textures, to identify main melodic parts, \ncontrapuntal lines, or overall rhythmic structures. While listening to Thai music—in particular, \nceremonial music—the unfamiliar listener could be overwhelmed by the hierarchical \ncomplexity produced by the independent musical layers of the various instruments. One of the \nmain reasons behind this confusion for those unfamiliar with the music is that in Thai classical \nmusic every instrument has its own separate function and distinct musical role when \n",
    "71": " \nCHAPTER 3: Identifying Musical Elements of dontri thai doem \n \n \n55 \nperforming in an ensemble.140 The term in Thai music thang khrueang dontri (“style of \ninstrumental music”) refers to the specific idiosyncratic function that each musician in an \nensemble must carry out in order to interpret Thai compositions to suit the character of their \ninstrument. In short, each musician performs the music based on the idiomatic way of playing \nhis or her particular instrument.   \n \nMuch like jazz musicians who learn the skill of improvising over chord changes, musicians in \nThai classical music construct their melodic lines based on the sound produced by the khong \nwong yai (gong circles), which creates the outline of melodic movements in Thai classical music. \nThe khong wong yai usually begins with the fundamental music line called luk khong. Luk khong \nfunctions as the primary nuclear melody of Thai classical compositions that musicians must \naccurately learn and explicitly understand in terms of its movement. There are three different \ncategories for patterns in luk khong lines: 1) restricted patterns, 2) semi-restricted patterns, and \n3) unrestricted patterns. These categories refer to the level of flexibility that the khong player is \nallowed to have—similar to varying levels of melodic embellishment a jazz musician might \nemploy in performance.  \n \nAnother significant musical layer is thang ranad (style for keyboard percussion instruments), \nwhich is typically divided into two categories including thang ranad ek (style for higher-pitched \nkeyboard percussion instruments) and thang ranad thum (style for lower-pitched keyboard \npercussion instruments). It is the thang ranad ek that may mislead unfamiliar ears to consider it \nas a fundamental melody when listening to Thai music, due to its characteristic sound being \nclear and rhythmically concrete. One of the musical techniques used to construct thang ranad ek \nis called plae thamnong (แปลทํานอง) (the performance methods for modifying main melodies to suit \ninstrumental idioms), which can be related to structural idiomatic improvisation based on the \nluk khong principal melody. John Garzoli and Bussakorn Binson summarize this kind of \nimprovisation as follows:  \n \nAs with jazz and other music involving improvisation, Thai improvisation is based on the principle of \nembellishing or transforming an underlying musical structure, in this case the nuea phleng [nuea means \nmeat, phleng means song; nuea phleng is not heard in performance]. The primary function of this layer of \nmusical structure is to act as a referent; the nuea phleng models the principles of musical organization \ninherent in the song which the performer then follows when creating melodic variations. In following \n                                                        \n140 There are three different types of instrument ensembles that mainly appear in Thai classical music. These are \nthe Piphat (a melodic percussion and reed instrument ensemble), Khruang Sai (a string ensemble), and Mahori, (a \ndiverse ensemble comprised of melodic percussion, reed, and string instruments.) For more details, see: Yuhpho, \nThai Musical instrument and Thai Musical ensemble, 79. \n",

This is demonstrated in Figure \n3.7, where the pitches in the red circles identify the location of the luk tok, which is the note \nA.143 To utilize the plae thamnong technique, a ranad ek player must create melodic lines that land \non the note A, synchronizing the line with the damped stroke called chap (+), examples of \nwhich are provided in three different approaches. Plae thamnong techniques can also be the \nproduct of pre-composed materials taught by a teacher, or of spontaneous improvisation by \nexperienced players. According to Panya Roongruang, the aesthetic of plae thamnong techniques \ndepends on how ranad players are able to render the sound of luk khong, writing that “the beauty \nof the thang of ranad’s variation is based on the performer [who] can bring together his/her \nmemory of the luk-khong.”144 The use of plae thamnong techniques also plays a crucial role in \ncontributing to the density of musical textures and the richness of rhythmic complexity in Thai \nmusic. \n                                                        \n141 John Garzoli and Bussakorn Binson, “Improvisation, Thang, and Thai Musical Structure,” Musicology Australia \n40, no.12 (2018), 61-62. \n142 Somneuk Saengaroon and Narutt Suttachitt, “Thai Classical Music Composition Content of Lt.

Another plae thamnong technique that is prominent in Thai classical \nperformances is thang pi nai, the style of pi nai, a predominant reed instrument in Thai \nensembles. One of the main functions of pi nai in Thai ensembles is to intertwine with the \nsound of each of the other individual instruments.

In addition, the other two \nroles that seem to be important for a pi nai player, are 1) contributing to the musical expression, \n(e.g., joyful, sad, angry)145 and 2) create a musical interpretation of a so-called “foreign accent” \n                                                        \n145 To express such musical emotions, the player may produce multiple staccato tones (tremolo), or play a fast \npassage in the short-range close to a target pitch, similar to a turn or mordent in Western music.

For example, \nPanya Roongraung has stated that “Thai music is linear and non-harmonic. Its texture is \ndescribed as idiomatic heterophony in which each instrument plays its own specific idiom \nbased on the same principal melody.”148 David Morton argues otherwise, writing:  \nNot the relationship of one melody to an underlying progression of solid complexes of sound, as in \nWestern harmonic music, but the relationship of one melody to specific variants of itself—one idea \nviewed simultaneously from several different viewpoints, multiplicity within unity—characterizes Thai \nensemble music. The technique of combining simultaneously one main melody and its variants is often \nincorrectly described as heterophony; polyphonic stratification seems a more precise description, since \neach of the “layers” is not a close approximation of the main melody but has distinct characteristics and \na style of its own.149  \n                                                        \n146 As previously discussed, Thai music originates from the transculturation of multiple musical cultures. \nConsequently, samninag phasa refers to different musical “accents” produced and interpreted by Thai musicians; \nsamninag jin describes the musical accent from Chinese; samninag Lao describes the musical accent from Lao; and \nsamninag mon refers to the musical accent of the Mon people. \n147 This illustration was taken from the “Khaek Borathet Thao”’s music manuscript.

    "75": " \nCHAPTER 3: Identifying Musical Elements of dontri thai doem \n \n \n59 \nPerhaps the most suitable answer to the question of whether Thai classical music’s textures are \nheterophonic or polyphonic may be dependent on what types of compositions are being \nperformed and by what types of ensembles. Terry Miller states: \nPiphat music of theater and ceremony tends to be motivic and the differences in idioms among the \ninstruments rather great; but piphat music in sepha style tends to be more lyrical, with slighter differences \namong the instruments. The former is comparable to polyphonic stratification, and the latter is \ncomparable to heterophony. Beyond that, Thai music exhibits passages that are nearly polyphonic, not \nthe result of chance combinations but stemming from compositional processes. Broadly speaking, then, \nthe texture of Thai classical ensemble music is heterophonic in that each musician realizes the preexisting \nmelodic structure in the idiom peculiar to his or her instrument or voice.150 \nThe various textures of Thai classical music are crucial parts of my compositional approach in \nthis project of music for jazz orchestra. I often use these textures in my work in conjunction \nwith homophonic texture, which I will discuss in my analysis of my pieces in Chapter 7. \nRHYTHM AND METER  \nRhythm and meter are also significant elements of Thai classical music. Many Thai classical \ncomposers use a time signature of 2/4 due to the fact that the accented beat found in Thai \nclassical music is typically located on the fourth beat (i.e., 1 2 3 4, or 1 & 2 & in eighth notes), \nrather than on the first beat as is common in Western music. This 2/4 concept was first \nintroduced by the Fine Arts Department committee in 1929 in an attempt to preserve Thai \nclassical music by using Western notation to transcribe the musical parts of the Thai \nensemble.151 Even so, this 2/4 system still has not been met by a complete consensus among \nThai classical musicians, though it is widely used in Thai classical music research—in particular \nin cross-cultural compositional aspects—and still remains the standard method for \ninternational musicians working in Thai music studies. Moreover, for my research, this method \nhelps avoid confusion and provides articulate clear perspectives based on jazz composition \n \nIn contrast to Western music, rhythm in Thai classical music seems to primarily function as a \nmusical indicator rather than as a way of constructing sophisticated rhythmic variations or \ncontributing stimulating pulses.152 There are two main forms of rhythm in Thai classical music \nemployed by ensembles, namely 1) jangwa ching (rhythm defined by the ching, finger cymbals) \n                                                        \n150 Miller and Williams, The Garland Handbook of Southeast Asian Music, 147. \n151 Narkkong, “Aspect of Improvisation in Thai Classical Drumming with special reference to the Taphon,” 72. \n152 In addition to ching, krab, mong, chab, taphon, thon, rammana, klong that, and klong khaek are all common percussion \ninstruments in Thai classical music. \n",
    "76": " \nCHAPTER 3: Identifying Musical Elements of dontri thai doem \n \n \n60 \nand 2) jangwa nathap (patterns related to drums in the thon category of goblet-shaped drums).153 \nIn both forms, rhythmic patterns function as a musical gauge that must be synchronized to the \nmelodic structures during performances, and play a crucial role when composing Thai classical \nmusic. To generate the sound of jangwa ching, musicians produce two distinct sounds from a \nching instrument: the undamped stroke called ching and the damped stoke, termed chap. These \ntwo strokes are continually performed in various patterns to create cyclical rhythms and are \ntypically heard in Thai music. Exceptions to this include instances when the ching player plays \nonly the ching or chap sound, moments when tremolo techniques are used, or passages where \nthe ching asymmetrically switches between those two sounds, depending on the type of \ncomposition.  \n \nChing patterns can be divided into two categories: 1) jangwa ching saman, consisting of \napproximately different twelve patterns, and 2) jangwa ching phiset, which consists of at least six \npatterns used to accompany different characters two forms of Thai theater, khon154 and lakhon \nchatri.155 Patterns from both categories are often performed in Thai classical music, but I will \nillustrate only three patterns from jangwa ching saman, namely, the chan dio, song chan, and sam chan \npatterns—all of which have influenced my work as a jazz composer. Indeed, one must be able \nto understand the concept of jangwa ching saman in order to generate musical ideas on how Thai \nmelodic movements function with instruments providing rhythmic accompaniment. \n \nThe concept chan in the names of the three patterns of jangwa ching saman refers to the ideal \ntempos that ching performers must indicate in an ensemble. For example, chan dio refers to a \nfast tempo, song chan, a medium tempo (which is widely practiced in the ancient Thai music \nrepertoire), and sam chan, a slow tempo, which is used in extended musical forms in Thai music \ncompositions known as Thao—which were originally created during the early Rattanakosin \nperiod and initially invented by Pra Pradit Pairoh (Mee Duriyangkul).156  \n \n                                                        \n153 I exclude “jangwa saman,” which is not related to a cyclical rhythm concept, but refers to the typical ideas of \nhuman rhythmic pulse and general tempo, e.g., fast, medium, slow. \n154 The masked drama is based on the Thai version of the Indian ancient epic, Ramayana.  \n155 One of Thailand’s oldest surviving forms of dance-drama, with significant ties to nora, a traditional Southern \nThai performance. See Chapter 5.  \n156 Montri Tramote, “The Evolution of Thai music in the Rattanakosin period,” Sirindhorn lecture series vol. 6, \nChulalongkorn University,<https://www.cca.chula.ac.th/protocol/images/book/pdf/book-sirinthorn06.pdf> \n(19 July 1990).  \n",
    "77": " \nCHAPTER 3: Identifying Musical Elements of dontri thai doem \n \n \n61 \nTo indicate the pattern of jangwa ching in sam chan, song chan, and chan dio, the players indicate \nprecisely the sound of the ching and chap, which are equal to a half note in eight measures for \nsam chan (fast, or third level), a quarter note in four measures for song chan (medium tempo, or \nsecond level), and to an eighth note within two measures for chan dio (slow tempo, or first level) \nwhen writing in Western musical notation (Figure 3.9). As Figure 3.9 illustrates, the pattern of \nching song chan and ching chan dio starts on the pickup measure due to the accented beat of Thai \nmusic, as mentioned above. \n \n \nFigure 3.9: Jangwa ching patterns. \n \nThe second concept, jangwa nathap, is notable in Thai classical music composition due to its \ncyclical form. In jangwa nathap, the two distinctly Thai rhythmic patterns nathap propkai and \nnathap song mai157 can provide useful means of understanding the framing of melodic phrases of \nThai music, which must be synchronized and relatively restricted into each nathap cycle.  \n \nTo produce such nathap patterns, musicians perform them on two-headed percussion \ninstruments, such as double-head barrel drums taphon or klong khaek, or on the pair of single-\nheaded drums thon and rammana. The syllables thang, thing, ja, and jo are used to describe four \ndifferent types of sounds that constitute nathap patterns.

This larger unit of structure could be \ncompared with the concept of a “chorus” in jazz, where a cycle of a particular duration and \nharmonic progression repeats. When two, three, or four thons (choruses) are combined, they \nform a complete movement, called a chan. Analyzing a chan as if each thon were a chorus, from \na jazz perspective, can provide insight into commonalities shared among jazz and Thai classical \nmusic. In addition, the rhythmic pattern of nathap probkhai is also known to be employed in \nThai compositions that contain less syncopation of the melodic line, and more predictable \nrhythmic phases.159  \n \nNathap song mai is a nathap pattern commonly used in shorter pieces which typically feature \nsyncopated melodic lines and uneven melodic phrases. Nathap song mai is also characterized by \nthe thang, thin, jo, and ja sounds, just like nathap probkhai when performing klong khaek. In \ncomparison with nathap probkhai, the duration of nathap song mai is half as long, with four \nmeasures for sam chan, two measures for song chan, and a one-bar pattern in chan dio. Nathap song \nmai can also be widely found in the style called samninag lao (the “Lao accent” style of Thai \nclassical music), in compositions such as “Lao Duang Duen,” “Lao Siangtian,” and “Lao Kham \nHom.” Lastly, it is also important to note that when performing these two nathap patterns, Thai \npercussionists also allow the addition of certain rhythmic embellishments called sai (ส่าย), and \nthe addition of a small rhythmic fragment called len mai.160  These musical techniques can help \nthe rhythmic features of Thai classical music to become more unexpected.

In a form of oral tradition, \nThai composers would formally transfer the musical knowledge of traditional pieces or create \nnew variations and personal adaptions out of traditional music and later teach them to pupils. \nBut, from a traditional perspective, this process was intended to help Thai composers to \npreserve the characteristic sound of traditional music, and to maintain the traditional practices \nand values passed down through several generations of masters.161 \n \nLike all living traditions, Thai classical music compositional approaches have adapted as the \nworld has modernized, and these approaches have become more comprehensive and \n                                                        \n161 Somnuek Saengarun personal interview 27 July 2020. \n",

In Thai classical music composition today, compositional concepts can be \ntypically divided into three categories: bangkhap thang (fully composed, required to be performed \nin the exact version of the composer), mai bangkhap thang (composed only in terms of the main \nstructure and allowing performers to apply improvisation techniques called plae thamnong), and \nkeung bangkahp thang-mai bangkhap thang (กึ#งบังคับทาง-ไม่บังคับทาง)(partly performed according to the \ncomposer’s exact version and partly allowing performers to improvise).162  \n \nThe well-known traditional composition method developed by Pra Pradit Pairoh (Mee \nDuriyangkul) entails the creation of a new composition by applying melodic and rhythmic \naugmentations as well as diminution techniques to an existing composition’s melodic lines. \nThese melodies and rhythms are based in song chan (second level), then extend to sam chan (third \nlevel), and again from song chan to reduce chan dio (first level), and then the three levels are \ncombined together to produce one extended composition, called thao,163 which consists of three \nmovements. (It can also be referred to as a suite from the perspective of jazz composition.)  \n \nIn the composition “Khaek Toi Moh” by Montri Tramote, a prominent Thai composer, and \nrespected teacher, Montri employs the compositional technique of Pra Pradit Pairoh. He takes \na melodic version of the traditional piece “Khaek Toi Moh” in song chan (which is widely \nperformed in Thai dramatic dance), and then extends it to the thao compositional type (Figure \n3.16).164 \n                    \n                                                        \n162  Personal interview with Somnuek Saengarun on July 27, 2020. \n163 In addition, Thao is also famous for lyrical music in which Thai composers display an expressive and emotional \nuse of bot seapa (Thai poems) from Thai literature, and perform by alternating between instrumental and lyrical \nsections. \n164 The full score of “Khaek Toi Moh” can be found in Montri Tramote, Thai Music Manuscript Vol.1, 155-157. \n",

The phrase structures \nof the composition are also significant: they double from eight measures in song chan to sixteen \nmeasures in sam chan, while target pitches are equally divided across four measures in chao dio. \nThese target notes may be necessary elements for accommodating Thai classical music \ncomposers’ formulation of new compositions. Composers of Thai classical music also employ \nthe sounds of approach notes according to their aesthetic choices, with Montri mentioning that \n \nFor the core concept of the augmentation and diminution in Thai compositions, indeed the most \nimportant part is to construct the pitches that [are] mandatorily based on the sound of “luk tok” in the \noriginal compositions, but for the melodic movements that [are] construct[ed] in the middle of each \n",

Because they must use \ntheir musicianship and artistic inspirations to construct musical melodic lines, most of the good \ncomposers construct the sound that glides smoothly and gently [to] connect each story together, similar \nto the construction of Thai poems.165 \n \nBesides the augmentation and diminution compositional techniques applied in thao \ncomposition, Thai composers also construct new extended musical compositions by \ncombining old musical pieces (e.g., in a suite). Examples of this practice include 1) phleng ruang, \nan instrumental suite consisting of several traditional Thai compositions with a common \ntheme, 2) phleng homrong, an instrumental suite mainly employed to open the performance—\nsimilar to an overture in Western music—and often performed in religious ceremonies and \ntheatrical performances, and 3) phleng tap (เพลงตับ), an lyrical suite which is divided into two \ncategories—tab ruang, which concentrates on the meaning of lyrics that can be combined \ntogether in the related context, and tap phleng, which focuses on the similar sound of certain \nmelodic lines rather than composition lyrics. In contrast to phleng thao, phleng ruang, and phleng \nhomrong, phleng tap applies no augmentation and diminution of the melodic parts of certain \ntraditional pieces, but may be constructed by selecting repertoires in various tempos. For \nexample, phleng ruang ching phra chan klang wan (เพลงเรื.องฉิ.งพระฉันกลางวัน) is composed of the \ncombination of traditional pieces in different tempos, and consists of selected pieces in song \nchan (second level) and chan dio (first level).166 \n \nAnother compositional technique widely utilized in Thai classical music, and related to jazz \ncomposition, is melodic variation. According to Uthit Naksawat, this melodic variation \napproach, known as thang plien (ทางเปลี.ยน), is often used in works to develop new musical \nconcepts and evoke sensations of surprise in listeners.167 To implement this technique, Thai \ncomposers still strictly follow the rule of retaining the original pitches located in strong beats \nfrom the original melody (luk khong), and recreate the melodic lines (e.g., Figure 3.17).168  \n                                                        \n165 Montri Tramote et al., Thai Music Manuscript Vol.1, (Bangkok: The Fine Arts Department, 1996), 193-194. \n166 Kee Chantasorn, “The Analytical Study of Plaeng Rueang Ching Phra Chan Klang Wan A Case Study of Khong \nWong Yai,” Research and Development Journal Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University” 9, no. 2 (2017), 158-164. \n167 Naksawat, Thai music theory and how to practice, 23. \n168 This example was acquired from Uthit Naksawat, Thai music theory and how to practice, 23-24. \n",

One of these techniques is to create a \nunique cadence for concluding sections called luk mot. A luk mot is a recognizable melodic line \nthat operates similarly to concluding riffs in a blues. By including a luk mot to conclude a jazz \ncomposition, it can help Thai audiences to identify when a piece is ending in a particularly Thai \nway. The utilization of luk mot in Thai compositions is employed in two different ways: 1) \nconstructing a luk mot that has melodic lines, or 2) implementing a luk mot that contains no \nmelodic lines (approach lines) that correlate to the composition. Most important from a \ntraditional perspective is that the ending pitch of luk mot patterns must finish in luk long yod, \nwhich is relatively equal to the pitch D in Western music.169  It is also noticeable that the \nimplementation of luk mot sound must be related to the samniang (musical accents) of selected \ncompositions (e.g., luk mot samniang, Kheak, Lao, Mon, Burma, and so on). An example of a luk \nmot appears in Figure 3.18.170 \n \n                                                        \n169 Siriluk Changlongtham, “The principal of using Luk mot”.

Luk yon works similarly to a musical bridge or a pedal point in jazz \ncomposition. The application of luk yon and luk tao must be sustained by one recurring target \npitch, and can be located at the beginning of a song or the beginning of separate sections, as \ndemonstrated in Figure 3.19.171  \n \n \nFigure 3.19: Luk yon, with target pitches circled in red.  \n \nWa dok, (ว่าดอก) as explained by my interviewee Somnuek Saengarun, is another compositional \nstyle that is widely used to construct additional sections, particularly in a type of Thai classical \nmusic known as phleng la (a farewell song). This compositional approach is to formulate a short \ninstrumental solo between sections of vocal performance (wa dok). These solos are usually \nplayed by the pi nai, to give a musical interpretation of grief and to express nostalgic emotions \nas the solo interacts with the vocals.

These approaches help express the \ncharacter of an ensemble, and include 1) tremolo (thang kro), 2) a broken fragment of a melody \n(luk lo), 3) call and response (luk kut)173, 4) the melodic displacement of rhythm (luk leuam) \n(ลูกเหลื.อม), and 5) a combination of various instrumental techniques mainly used in solo \ncomposition (thang khap luk khap dok)(ทางคาบลูกคาบดอก).

As mentioned \nearlier, Thai classical music prioritizes featuring each instrument’s individual character. The \npurpose of the luk leuam technique is to highlight the character of a secondary instrument \nreferred to as ranad thum, which has a playful role in Thai classical music and performs the \nprimary melodic patterns of composition one beat ahead while being followed by the usual \nlead instrument, a ranad ek (Figure 3.24).175  \n \n \nFigure 3.24: Luk leuam technique in “Kluen Kratob Fung.” \n \nOne last compositional method of Thai classical music relevant to jazz composition is referred \nto as thang khap luk khap dok (ทางคาบลูกคาบดอก).

To apply thang khap luk khap dok, which is widely utilized \nin solo composition (phleng dio), Thai composers shift between instrumental ornaments—for \nexample, between single melodic pitch tremolo (rua), and thang kep (an instrumental technique \nusing a set of eight notes, mainly in an octave similar to plae thamnong techniques). This method \ncan create irregular musical textures that musically produce more complicated rhythmic ideas \nand sophisticated melodic patterns.

Besides thang khap \nluk khap dok, other techniques that appear in Thai compositional methods include the use of a \nset of three grace notes (sabat, sadot) for melodic embellishment sections, or the implementation \nof continuous sixteenth notes in idiomatic improvisation to create an intensity in texture known \nas khayi (ขยี%). \n \n \n                                                        \n175 The transcription of “Kluen Kratob Fung” was obtained from Uthit Naksawat’s book, Theory and Practice \nof Thai Classical Music, page 34.  \n",

One example of this is my arrangement of \n“Giant Steps” by John Coltrane, which uses the augmentation and diminution techniques \nemployed in thao compositions (Figure 3.25). As can be seen, in the B section, I expand “Giant \nSteps” from its original 4/4 to a 5/4 time signature, which is inspired by thao compositional \napproaches. Subsequently, I reduce the time signature of this section from 5/4 to 4/4, then to \n3/4, in the way Thai composers generate thao compositions, which begin with sam chan, song \nchan, and chan dio. To provide add more complexity, in the C section, I additionally displace \nthese three different time signatures to give the illusion of irregular meters.176 \n \nFigure 3.25: Arrangement of “Giant Steps” inspired by thao compositional technique. \n                                                        \n176 See Appendix A.2 for a full score. \n",

Understanding the sacred and spiritual doctrine of Thai people’s belief is \nalso an important element of understanding Thai classical music. Before performing Thai \nmusic, Thai musicians usually hold their hands together tightly with the sticks of their \ninstruments and then bring them above their heads, which their minds follow by contemplating \ntheir deities, teachers, and parents to appreciate the spiritual moments and musical knowledge \nthat they have received, and also to pay respect to the instrumental spirits that they believe are \nsymbolically embodied by Thai musical instruments. \n \nThe hierarchy of Thai music compositions used in sacred ceremonies can also be observed in \nthree different types of pieces, namely, 1) phleng khru (respected pieces) 2) phleng saksit (sacred \npieces which must be respected), and 3) phleng suung (เพลงสูง) (restricted pieces which must be \nhighly respected).178 All such music types may also be located in the phleng naphat category, \nwhich explicitly contains inconstant melodic lines, free rhythmic approaches, and asymmetrical \nmeasures,179 and which generate opposite perceptions to the lyrical music types demonstrated \nearlier. To learn such music, Thai musicians must strictly acquire knowledge from their \nteachers, who will carefully provide the musical knowledge of phleng naphat according to a \nstudent’s level of musicianship. Typical names of compositions in phleng naphat include \n“Saathukarn”—a musical piece of worship of the three gems of Buddhism; “Tra Homrong,” \n“Tra Choen,”(ตระเชิญ) “Tra Sannitbat”—musical pieces used for the deities’ invitation;180 “Rua \nSam La”—a particular composition that invokes the act of the deities’ salutation and \ndemonstration of their powers; “Choet”(เชิด)—a musical composition of the processional \n                                                        \n178 Wong, Sounding the Center: History and Aesthetics in Thai Buddhist Performance, 104. \n179 Ibid., 105. \n180 Naksawat, Thai music theory and how to practice, 122. \n",

Tramote describes the five levels as follows. The \nfirst level is an initiation in which a student takes flowers, incense, a candle, and a designated \namount of money to the teacher, who will later grasp the student’s hands and start to play the \nfirst piece of traditional Thai music called “Saathukarn” on a khong wong yai in the first \nceremony. The second level proceeds only after the student has completely learned the evening \noverture (the standard ritual music repertoire).

This notion has also resulted in Thai musicians being more open to foreign \ncultures, as evidenced by their use of foreign instruments and adoption of what they call foreign \nmusical accents. For Thai classical music, each ensemble has its own unique way of tuning their \ninstruments, which is referred to as “intonation diversity,” an important considering when \nundertaking a project of musical hybridization of Thai music with music for jazz orchestra.  \n \nDespite that diversity, many Thai instruments produce pitches in, or close to, Western tuning, \nwhich can be transcribed in Western staff notation as approximations. Thai classical music, \nunlike Western music, contains no harmonic progression; instead, it is composed of multiple \ndistinct lines in the style of thang khrueang dontri. Thai musical textures can relate to idiomatic \nheterophony or polyphonic stratification depending on the style of composition. Two concepts \nof Thai rhythm that are important are jangwa ching, and jangwa nathap, which function as a \nmusical gauge for Thai classical musical performances. These two notions are also strongly \nconnected to chan, which refers to the ideal tempos and is divided into three levels: sam chan, \nsong chan, and chan dio.  Rhythmic patterns of nathap propkai and nathap song mai also appear to be \nused as accompaniments for drum, bass, and piano parts. \n \nWhen writing thao compositions, composers of Thai classical music use the concept of chan, in \nwhich old traditional music pieces were diminished and expanded to produce a new work. In \naddition, this technique can be combined with other jazz compositional approaches to generate \nan innovative method for jazz arranging, as demonstrated in my arrangement of “Giant Steps.” \nOther compositional approaches used in Thai classical music are comparable to those used in \njazz, also include combining songs with similar melodic characters to create a suite (phleng ruang), \nor building extended sections, such as an introduction (luk yon) or an outro (luk mot). In \naddition, thang kro, luk leuam, luk lo, and luk kut all appear to be beneficial and provide distinct \ntechniques effective in both arranging and composing for a small jazz ensemble, as evidenced \nin my preliminary work, “Nanapa.”\n",

    "97": " \nCHAPTER 4:  Investigating the Musical Aspects of dontri isan nuea \n \n \n81 \nfrom Mahasarakham Province, to provide an in-depth example of an isan nuea performance. \nThrough my preliminary works, I offer several compositional approaches for incorporating \nisan nuea melodies, such as “Lai Ka Ten Kon” and “Lai Nok Sai Bin Kham Thung,” into jazz \ncompositions. To close the chapter, I briefly discuss a traditional isan nuea singing style called \nmawlum, drawing on work by both Terry E. Miller and Chaweewan Dumnern. \n \nTHE TRADITIONAL MUSIC OF NORTHEAST THAILAND (DONTRI ISAN \nNUEA) \n \nAccording to Charoen Chaichonphairote,185 three prominent and distinct musical cultures that \nhave been in practice in the northeast Thailand include: 1) the musical culture of the upper area \nof the region (isan neua), which consists of fourteen provinces, mainly influenced by Thai-Lao \nethnic groups; 2) the musical practices of the lower area known as isan tai (อีสานใต้)(which refers \nto the south), consisting of three provinces, primarily influenced by Khmer music; and 3) the \nmusical culture of the Thai-Khorat people located in Nakhon Ratchasima Province—which \nhas partly influenced the music culture of central Thailand. I focus here on the music of the \nThai-Lao upper area (isan nuea), and on the ways I have adapted this music in my hybridization \nprocesses as a composer. \n \nThis particular style of music depicts the way of life of Thai-Lao communities who live in the \nwide plain area where the Mekong River is a symbol of the people’s lives and is crucial to their \nsurvival—particularly for the region’s agriculture, as the weather can be harsh and marked by \nextreme drought, especially during the summer, from late January to the middle of May. \nConsequently, the sound of music from isan nuea serves as the musical expression of its people, \nwho sing and play instruments to heal their suffering in such hostile weather conditions—\ncommunicating with local spirits186 for encouragement when they are sick (lum phi faa), \nentertaining themselves after finishing work in a paddy field, or providing music for their \nreligious processions (hae)(แห่), such as hae bangfai (แห่บั%งไฟ), or hae phawet (แห่ผะเหวด). \n                                                        \n185 Charoen Chaichonphairote is a prominent Thai ethnomusicologist specializing in the traditional music of \nnortheast Thailand and has been teaching at Mahasarakham University—where the musical culture of \nnortheastern Thailand is largely practiced. For more details on the historical musical knowledge of northeastern \nThai music, please see Charoen Chaichonphairote’s book, The Traditional music of northeast Thailand, (Bangkok: \nSrinakharinwirot University press, 1983). \n186 Even though the musical practices of northeast Thailand seem to be less ceremonial when compared to Thai \nclassical music, the practice of wai khru (paying respect to the teachers) and other ceremonial music used to praise \nlocal spirits—in particular for Phaya Tan (พญาแถน)—still can be observed in the region and its style. \n",
    "98": " \nCHAPTER 4:  Investigating the Musical Aspects of dontri isan nuea \n \n \n82 \n4.2 PITCH AND INSTRUMENTS \n \nThe traditional music of northeastern Thailand uses a set of seven diatonic pitches similar to \nthose in Thai classical music, and its melodic structures are also predominantly based on a \npenta-centric concept. The original tuning systems of isan nuea music were developed from \ndiverse methods in disparate provinces—a subject that needs more evidence-based research to \nprove various hypotheses on the original tuning practices in remote areas.187 However, \nnowadays, some instruments from this musical region have been widely produced by adapting \nthe Western tuning system (A=440) as their standard, a process which is referred to as sieng \nsakon. These instruments can be performed with Western instruments, and their performances \nlend themselves to transcription in Western notation more efficiently than those of Thai \nclassical music. One of the limitations that seems to occur with isan nuea musical instruments, \nfrom my perspective as a jazz composer, is that one instrument is only capable of playing in \none key (e.g., khaen in Am, or wot in Dm), which may cause difficulty for isan nuea performers \nwhen employing key modulation. (Isan nuea musicians prefer to refer to the key of their musical \ninstruments in the minor). To begin the discussion, I describe the use of isan nuea instruments \nand how they can function in a jazz composer’s setting. \n \nKHAEN \n \nA khaen is a bamboo mouth-organ used in northeast Thailand and Laos.188 When performing, \nthe player covers the small holes that have been drilled in each small pipe, located on the left \nand right sides. The range of the instrument is the two-octave diatonic scale for a khaen paet \n(with sixteen pipes in total on the two sides), which is commonly employed in isan nuea music. \nOther instruments in the khaen family consist of 1) khaen hok, the smallest organ (six pipes in \ntotal, e.g., the khaen hok in G is capable of producing G, A, C, D, E, and G­ , 2) khaen jed \n(fourteen pipes in total—e.g., a khaen jed in Am—consisting of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A­,  B ­, \nC­, D,­ E,­, and F ­, i.e., less than two octaves), and 3) khaen kao, the biggest organ (with \neighteen pipes in total, a khaen kao in Am is capable of producing A, B, C, D, E, G, A­,  B ­, \n                                                        \n187 For more details on isan tuning system, see chapter Miller’s chapter, The Kaen Reed-Organ, its Description \nand History, “Kaen Playing and Mawlum Singing in Northeast Thailand,” (1977). \n188 Other bamboo mouth-organ-based instruments with different structures and names are also played in Vietnam \nand by ethnic minorities in South China. See, Sujit Wongthes, “Thai Music refers to the musical practice of center \nThailand, other musical regions are excluded.” Matichon online  \n< https://www.matichon.co.th/columnists/news_210907>, (13 July 2016).  \n",

Please note that multiple pipes on the same khaen \nmay produce the same pitch.189  \n \nThe khaen paet (sixteen-pipe model) is the instrument that most frequently appears in isan nuea \nperformances. It is also capable of performing as a solo instrument or accompanying a singer, \nalso known as molam. Unlike the fingering of Western music mouth-organs, which are \nsequentially arranged from lower pitches to higher pitches, the fingerings used to play a khaen \npaet can be disorienting, but are effective for the pentatonic concepts and traditional melodies \nof isan nuea (Figure 4.1).190  \n \nFigure 4.1: Khaen paet’s fingering. The right hand’s fingers move among the adjacent \nright-hand pipes (1–8), while the fingers of the left hand do the same for the left had \npipes (9–16). \n \nAnother striking characteristic produced by the khaen is a drone. Similar to Hindustani classical \nand Carnatic music in India, the use of sustained pitches—known as sieng sep (เสียงเสพ)—can be \nalso observed in khaen performances. A set of such sustained pitches, consisting of the root, \nP4, P5, and octave notes which are explicitly heard in isan nuea music are produced when the \nkhaen player consistently covers the holes corresponding with those pitches with their fingers. \nAlternatively, players fill such holes with adhesive substances called kitsoot 191 when performing \nto produce the same effect.   \n \nThe primary role of the khaen in isan nuea can also be observed as that of a lead instrument, \nwith the instrument providing a tuning pitch for ensembles, and musical adjustments of \ndynamics, articulations, and tempos when performing in a group. One of the most important \nmusical elements in isan nuea music is called lai. This term denotes the modes and melodic lines \n                                                        \n189 Sumrongthong et al., “Thai Music Culture: North Isan Region” (National Research Funding), (Bangkok: \nChulalongkorn University, 2017), 254-257. \n190 Christopher Adler, “Khaen the bamboo free-reed mouth organ of Laos and Northeast Thailand: Notes for \nComposers,” <http://christopheradler.com/khaen-for-composers.pdf> (17 June 2020). \n191 Kitsoot is black, sticky beeswax.

The tuning system of the phin is also fascinating, as it can \nbe based on different provinces’ perspectives (and thus is quite diverse), and must be adjusted \nto the sound of a drone (similar to a khaen) in each composition. For example, Chulalongkorn \nUniversity academics discovered the notion of the lai noi tuning system, which was founded in \nNong Kai Province and is tuned to D-A-G193—in contrast to Terry Miller’s study on lai noi, \nfrom a different region where the instrument is tuned to A-D-A.194  \n \nBased on my work with phin performers in 2016–2017 with the Faculty of Music, Silpakorn \nUniversity, and similar to Apiruk Phoosanga’s research195, several standard tuning techniques \nare now commonly used in phin performances, in contrast to regional tuning methods. These \nsystems are divided into three categories for a three-string phin: 1) E-A-E (the most widely-\nused); 2) E-A-A; and 3) E-B-E. There are four tuning categories for a two-string phin: 1) E-A; \n2) E-B; 3) E-D; and 4) E-E. Finally, four varieties of a four-string phin: 1) E-A-E-A; 2) E-A-E-\nB; 3) A-E-A-E; and 4) E-E-A-A. (Please note that the first letter refers to the first string—the \nlowest pitch—while the second refers to the second string, and so on). When playing the phin, \nisan nuea musicians also use a plectrum, or pick, that was originally made of buffalo or cow \nhorns. Nowadays, the pick often comprises of any plastic products that are easily found in \ncommunities. Phin players even sometimes use modern guitar picks to pluck the instrument’s \nstrings.  \n                                                        \n192 Sitthisak Champadaeng et al.,“Isan Khaen Player: Technique, Method, and Success in Playing,” Journal of \nHumanities and Social Sciences Mahasarakham University 38, no.1, 64. \n193 Sumrongthong et al.,“Thai Music Culture: North Isan Region, 260. \n194 Miller and Williams, The Garland Handbook of Southeast Asian Music, 172. \n195 Apiruk Phoosanga, “Lai Pin lsan: Compositional Technique and Performance Styles of Thongsai Tuptanon \nand Boomma Kaowong,” Master’s thesis, Mahasarakham University, (2019), 9. \n",

Thongsai Thabthanon’s \nstylistic performance is regarded as one of the forerunners of modern phin performance, using \nan electric phin (a phin with a pickup) in isan nuea ensembles. He is also known for being one of \nthe prominent isan nuea musicians to record phleng luk thung (Thai folk songs) with a phin. His \nperformances can also be heard in a number of isan nuea films, which I listened to several times \nbefore deciding to transcribe his performance. Boomma Kaowong, a visually impaired phin \nmaster, is acclaimed by isan musicians as the maestro of three-string phin and one of the most \nrhythmically skilled phin performers in isan performance. Additionally, he produced numerous \nmodern isan nuea melodies still widely used in the phin repertoire. \n \nFigure 4.2: “Lai Ka Ten Kon.” Transcription by the author. \n                                                        \n196 Figure 4.2 was transcribed from Thongsai Thabthanon’s performance of “Lai Ka Ten Kon” (0.00-0.29) \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DIi4Me1pG0> uploaded by Thongbass Thapthanon, (6 November \n2021). \n197 Boomma Kaowong’s performance of “Lai Kaeo Na Ma” in Figure 4.3 was transcribed from \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZFZRmIkEuI> (1.27- 1.52) uploaded by  \nMark Apirak (14 August 2019). \n",

From a vertical compositional perspective, these two transcriptions also illustrate that \nthe construction of phin performance can be built on both a single pitch and two pitches, which \nprimarily build up from minor 3rd, P4, P5, minor 7th, and an octave; alternatively, the players \nplay a set of three pitches, which usually build up from M2 and P4, and are equivalent to a \nsuspended chord in jazz harmony. In my transcriptions of “Lai Kaeo Na Ma” I have included \narticulation marks to show various characteristics of phin performance. For example, a phin \nplayer may accent the upbeat in order to provide strength in a syncopated rhythm when the \nphin is being used to accompany traditional isan nuea dances. Interestingly, these rhythmic \naccents appear to be comparable to a swing feel, which is commonly stressed on upbeats while \nplaying in eighth-note settings. Similar to khaen performance, both compositions use drones \n(sieng sep)—on the note D in the melodic patterns of “Lai Ka Ten Kon” and the note G in the \n“Lai Kaeo Na Ma” melody. Both are also based on the penta-centric concept. In addition, \nsixteenth notes are used in these two compositions to offer the performances a rhythmic \nintensity. 198 \n \nPONG LANG  \n \nPong lang is a melodic percussion instrument (a wooden xylophone) employed in different types \nof ensembles in isan nuea music. It was originally designed in Kalasin province to be used as a \nsignal indicator for annual events in communities, and to expel crows out of paddy fields.

(Figure 4.4 illustrates three distinct pong \nlang tuning systems, consisting of traditional tuning, standard tuning, and seven-pitch diatonic \ntuning.)  \n \nFigure 4.4: Pong lang tuning systems. \n \nUnlike Western xylophones, whose bars lay flat, the wooden bars of pong lang are tied together \nand hung on two vertical poles of differing heights, resulting in a profile similar to a right \ntriangle. The pong lang can be played by either one or two players. When it is played by two \nplayers, the one person plays melodic patterns, and the other plays a set of drones. It is also \nused as a solo instrument or to accompany traditional dances, including seng phu thai (tribal \ndance) and dances called seng swing (fishing net), seng tum na (farming), and seng yae kai mod dang \n(เซิ%งแหย่ไข่มด)(hunting red ant eggs).

Because isan nuea \ninstruments typically serve to accompany traditional dances, as a consequence, the rhythmic \npatterns in this particular music seem to be more aroused, excited, and more stimulated, in \ncomparison with other regional musical practices in Thailand. The Thai word klong refers to \nmembranophone instruments that uses to generate rhythm (jawang). And, for the isan nuea \npercussion category, it is klong hang or klong yao isan (a long tail drum), and ramana isan or klong \nteung (a medium-sized bass drum) that frequently appear in isan neua music. \n \nKlong hang produces three fundamental sounds: 1) Jo (the player uses the tip of their hand to \nmake a treble sound); 2) Tung (the player applies the whole right hand to make a bass sound) \nand teung (same as the construction of tung sound but the player switches to a left hand); and 3) \ntheng (the player either their left or right hand to make a bass sound out of the middle of the \n",

Theng is the only sound the klong hang is cable of making in ramana isan or klong teung, \nwhere it is performed together with kholaw (a Thai bamboo clave, using to emphasis the down \nbeat). \n \nVarious types of cymbals are used in isan nuea. The ching produces two sounds by damped and \nundamped stroke (the same as the one used in a Thai classical music ensemble). Chap lek is a \npair of small cymbals, producing two distinct sounds (i.e., chae [แช่] and wap [วับ]), which are \nproduced by the player slightly rubbing the cymbal surfaces against each other; when sliding \nthe cymbals in the opposite direction to the player’s position, the sound of chae is produced, \nand when sliding the cymbals back toward the player’s position, the sound of wap is made. Chap \nyai is similar to chap lek, but twice the size, and capable of making two sounds, called chap \n(damped stoke), and chae (undamped stoke). \n \n4.3 MUSICAL ELEMENTS \nLAI \n \nSimilar to thang in Thai classical music, the word lai is used in several ways in reference to \nsignificant elements of isan nuea.  It is being used in the names of traditional music pieces in \nisan nuea, especially ones that refer to nature and landscape, such as “Lai Ka Ten Kon,” (crows \ndance over rocks) and “Lai Maeng Phu Tom Dok” (bugs swarm flowers). It can also be the \nname of the sound of traditional isan nuea modes, such as lai yai, (equal to A minor pentatonic \nscale) or lai noi (equal to D minor pentatonic scale). In addition, lai is used in the names of \nrepetitive melodic lines, used in processions, such as lai seng bang fai205 or lai klawng yao (long \ndrum trail processions). Lastly, it is also used in the names of regional music accents, which \ninclude the names of geographical areas, such as “Lai Phu Thai Sakon Nakhon,” (the music of \na phu thai tribe in Sakon Nakhon province) or “Lai Phu Thai Kalasin” (the music of a phu thai \ntribe in Kalasin province).  \n \nI begin my discussion of lai in its meaning as the sound of modes, as this is the most important \nelement of the concept to my process of hybridizing isan nuea with jazz composition.

Nowadays, the six modes typically heard in isan nuea performances \nare divided into two groups 1. lai thang yao (equal to the structure of minor pentatonic scales), \nand 2. lai thang san (major pentatonic scales) (Figure 4.6).  \nlai thang yao \n \n1. lai yai, consisting of A, C, D, E, G (A minor pent.)  \n  \n \n2. lai noi, or lai long noi, consisting of D, F, G, A, C (D minor pent.) \n \n3. lai se, consisting of E, G, A, B, D (E minor pent.) \n \n \nlai thang san \n4. lai sutsanaen, consisting of C, D, E, G, A (C major pent.)  \n \n5. lai pong sai, consisting of F, G, A, C, D (F major pent.) \n  \n     \n6. lai soi, consisting of G, A, B, D, E (G major pent.) \n  \n \nFigure 4.6: Lai thang yao and lai thang san. \n \nAs isan nuea is based on the inspiration of the environment, entertaining communities, and \nproviding musical expression of people’s lives, the utilization of lai can help isan musicians \nexpress their musical feelings, such as pleasure (major tones) or sorrow (minor tones), and can \n",

The application of modes in isan nuea \nalso plays a crucial role in the practice of an improvisation in thamnong yoi (an improvisational \nsection) that isan nuea musicians apply to express their artistic stories through their instrument.  \n \nAs an example of how isan nuea musicians apply modes to the construction of melody and \nimprovisational elements, I transcribed a live recording of a performance in lai se207 (E minor \npentatonic scale) by the maw khaen Buahong Phajung, a khaen performer native to Udon Thani \nProvince. According to the Khon Kaen University’s Isan Artists’ Archive, Buahong began to \nlearn to play khaen from his father. He was also recognized in both Thailand and Laos and \ninvolved in the establishment of several philanthropic isan nuea music education organizations \nin provinces along the Thai-Lao border, including Nong Khai Province.208 I decided to \ntranscribe his lai se performance, revealing the utilization of motivic development crucial to this \nkhaen performance (Figure 4.7).209 \n \n \n                                                        \n206 John Garzoli, “Mawlam and jazz in intercultural musical synthesis,” Rian Thai: International Journal of Thai Studies \n11, no.1(2018), 14. \n207 Lai se is one of the traditional modes in isan neua that is not frequently heard.

The \nconstruction of this performance is primarily based on the E minor pentatonic scale, in which \nthe intervallic patterns predominantly build up from E, such as, E-G, E-A, and E-B, and play \nan important role in generating melodic lines from a horizontal viewpoint. \n",
    "110": " \nCHAPTER 4:  Investigating the Musical Aspects of dontri isan nuea \n \n \n94 \nTo intertwine musical ideas together, Buahong also uses several sixteenth-note motifs, such as \nA-G-E, which can be observed in mm.9-11 and m. 23. In addition, he plays staccato quarter \nnotes on beat one (in 2/4), which avoid the repetition of eighth notes frequently heard in the \nperformance. Rhythmic accents on the first and second upbeats can also be examined in a \nvariety of places. Importantly, the transcription of Buahong’s performance also reveals that \nchords generated by an E minor pentatonic scale, such as Gmaj, G6/9, Emin7, and Dsus4, are used \nin various places throughout the performance, providing homophonic texture to isan nuea \nmusic, as opposed to Thai classical musical texture, as described in Chapter 3. Other musical \ntechniques such as motivic displacement and repetitions can be also examined in the \ntranscription.210 \n \nThe most important concept from this transcription related to jazz composition is the way isan \nnuea musicians create and develop concise musical ideas that later connect to a big picture, a \nbroader, cohesive story. Charoen Chaichonphairote also states that to produce an effective lai, \nisan musicians produce a short motive, or construct multiple intervallic patterns based on the \nindividual notes from a particular lai (e.g., in lai yai [A minor pentatonic]).  \n \nThe player may start to construct the E note as the target pitch, and then move to A, followed by C, \nthen to other pitches. Eventually, the player tries to circulate all pitches within the lai yai. Expert \nmusicians can efficiently connect all the musical pitches and tell a story without providing interrupting \nmoods that also known Thai words as “phuk klon (ผูกกลอน) [intertwined poem].211  \n \nIn developing practical methods for my musical hybridization project, I have adapted the \napplication of lai yai (A minor pentatonic) to an open section of a bass solo I played, where I \nattempted to imitate the character sound of isan nuea music by 1) constructing the story from \nconcise and repetitive motifs in a similar manner to the previous transcription, 2) applying \ndrones related to khaen and phin performances, 3) employing related musical accents, on the \ndownbeats of beat one, and the upbeats of beats two and four, and 4) adapting similar melodic \npatterns to those that I have transcribed (Figure 4.8).212 By including a bass solo section like \nthis in jazz compositions, it can accommodate the sound character of isan nuea music, but \nproduced by the timbre of Western instruments.

To better understand the standard structure of isan nuea performance, I \ndecided to transcribe one of the most well-known lai (compositions) in isan nuea music \nrepertoires, called “Lai Teay Khong,” performed by Sombat Simlah, the khaen master from \nMahasarakham Province.215 Sombat Simlah’s rendition of “Lai Teay Kong” was chosen for \ntranscription because I was impressed by his ability to generate improvisation that is both \nmelodically and rhythmically challenging.

The construction of Lai Teay Klong is also \nbased on the structure of B♭ minor pentatonic scale which is divided into two sections \nconsisting of melody A (m.14) and melody B (m.30), together in a section called thamnong lak. \nThis section includes drones on B♭ and F, as well as staccato and accented ornaments. \nInterestingly, throughout this section, Sombat’s eighth-note rhythmic pattern is quite similar to \na swing rhythm. \n \n \nFigure 4.10: The B section of “Lai Teay Khong.” Transcription by the author. \n \nIn the C section, known as thamnong yoi, Sombat begins to generate the improvisation that is \nrelated to the theme of “Lai Teay Klong” (Figure 4.10).

First, I have begun to experiment to harmonize the melody parts of isan nuea (retain \nthe rhythm and the pitches of traditional melodies), by using jazz contemporary harmonies \n(e.g., using quartal harmony and chord extensions). Second, I have changed the melodic \npatterns of the traditional composition (e.g., modifying its rhythmic structure, and time \nsignature, then applying the jazz harmonies). Third, I have either retained or adjusted melodic \nparts of traditional composition, expanding the form of jazz composition out of the standard \ncontext, and applied the idiomatic improvisation of isan nuea to create a musical hybridity \nexpression And, because of the structural flexibility of pentatonic scales, typical of isan nuea \nmelodies, consequently, I was able to re-harmonize isan nuea traditional melodies smoothly and \npractically by using modern jazz harmonies. These three initial compositional methods \nsignificantly provided me with a better understanding of blending isan nuea and jazz harmonies, \nwhich I also apply to my compositions for jazz orchestra. \n \n4.4 PRELIMINARY COMPOSITIONS \n \nMy first adaptation of isan nuea music is a musical hybrid arrangement of “Lai Lom Phat Phrao” \n(Figure 4.13). I transcribed the melody parts of this piece from a video demonstration, provided \nby the Roi Et College of Dramatic Arts, Roi Et, Thailand.218 The melodic movement of this \ncomposition is based on an A minor pentatonic scale, which is melodically organized by the \nuse of repetition of the first two pitches in each short phrase, which occurs in mm.1-9 and \nmm.19-29. This creates the memorable sound of this composition. In this arrangement, I \ncreated a harmony that primarily focuses on the use of extended chords. These chords, such \nas D9sus, Fmaj9, C6/9, G-11, and A-11 are employed to contribute modern jazz harmonies based on \nthe melody of “Lai Lom Phat Phrao.” In addition, the harmonic rhythmic of this musical hybrid \narrangement also utilized the use of modal interchange, with V-7 referred to as G-11 being \nused in a multiple of locations. I then decided to complete the arrangement of this song by \nadding the rhythmic feel of fast swing, which contributes musical hybridity that combines a \nsense of Thai melody with a jazz rhythmic feel. \n                                                        \n218 Yothin Phonket, “Lai Lom Phat Phrao,” The Roi Et College of Dramatic Arts. \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4cUgPe04fw> (21 May 2017). \n",

Because of \nthe repetition of beats one and three that frequently occur in isan nuea music, which can produce \na sense of predictability, I decided to add anticipations so that the rhythms can appear on the \nupbeats of the second and fourth beats, providing a sense of syncopated rhythm, which is one \nof the robust musical elements and prominent characteristics of jazz. \n \nInspired by “Magnolia Triangle,” by Ellis Marsalis Jr, and “Blue Rondo à la Turk” by Dave \nBrubeck, I arranged the original melody of “Lai Nok Sai Bin Kham Thung” which consists of \na repetitive two-bar phrase, similar to the structure of the melody parts of “Magnolia Triangle” \nin a time signature of 5/4. This change significantly contributes to the rhythmic complexity of \nthe arrangement, in contrast to the simplicity typically generated by the melodic movement of \ntraditional music. To provide the musical elements of jazz for audiences, I decided to construct \nthis musical hybridization to be improvised in the style of a blues. I use a jazz-blues standard \nform and its chord progressions, and later switch between dominant based-harmonies in 5/4 \nrhythm influenced by “Blue Ronde a la Turk” (which also contains the integration of additive \nmeters, traditional melodies, and blues improvisation).

The head out section of this \narrangement, which is the I section, also provides the opportunity for the memorable melody \nof “Lai Teay Khong” to be heard again with the Countdown chord progression. Here, instead \nof fast swing, the rhythmic patterns performed emphasize the backbeat, with a laid-back feel, \nin a hip-hop style. Because of the diversity of rhythmic patterns and the remarkable character \nsound of this most famous composition in isan nuea music, I believe that this arrangement may \nsignificantly contribute to the practice of hybridizing disparate musical elements, as it \nimplements both jazz and isan nuea elements that can be recognized by audiences of both Thai \nmusic and jazz.221  \n \n \n \n \n Figure 4.15a: “Lai Teay Khong” arrangement. \n \n                                                        \n221 Appendix A.6 contains the complete arrangement of “Lai Teay Khong.” \n",

As mentioned earlier, the word maw in isan means ‘expert’ (n.), and \nlum means ‘sing’ (v.)222; consequently, the combination of mawlum points to an ‘expert singer’, \nor rather, the singing style in isan nuea music.223 The two main reasons why the mawlum style can \nsignificantly inspire aspects of jazz composition are the nostalgic sound of mawlum vocalists \nand their singing techniques, such as the application of blending pitches, fast and slow tremolo, \npitch vibrations, and the beauty of the metaphors used and the concinnity of stanzas, which \nare implemented in the movement of the lyrics.   \n \nThe construction of mawlum lyrics derives from ancient pieces of literature, poems, and \ntextbooks—in particular, nithan chadok (the Jataka Tales)224; alternatively, lyrics can be artistically \n                                                        \n222 Chaweewan Dumnern and Tongkam Taikla, “the Sangkeet Sin Center Vol 615, mawlum-mawkhaen”, \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-dFemBfGmU&feature=youtu.be> (2 October 2020). \n223 Terry E. Miller has further explained that mawlum refers to Maw (which means a “skilled person” as in mawyah \ndoctor), doo (doo: to see fortune teller), or maw-kuam (kuam: lawyer). Singing has also been called lum kaen in \nreference to the organ which accompanies the singing. In central Thailand, especially during the nineteenth and \nearly twentieth centuries, lum isan was known as aeow lao. Terry E. Miller and Charoen Chaichonphairote, “The \nMusical Traditions of Northeast Thailand,” Journal of the Siam Society (1979). \n224 The Jataka Tales is a story of the previous life of Buddha, originally written in India.

    "122": " \nCHAPTER 4:  Investigating the Musical Aspects of dontri isan nuea \n \n \n106 \nwritten by mawlum performers who necessarily utilize poetic metaphors to construct their \nrhymes and lyrical melodies, which must fit together with the sound of the accompanying \ninstrument (khaen). In general, the messages of mawlum lyrics may refer to the teachings of \nBuddha (to encourage and provide morality to people’s lives), unexpected grief and tragic \nstories (to warn and urge the listeners), or playful attitudes (for entertainment about the \nromances, courtships, or personal life experiences of mawlum performers). The lyrical \nimprovisation technique known as don klon (ด้นกลอน) also can be deployed while performing; as \na consequence, skillful mawlum are capable of performing complicated narratives containing \nexcellent rhymes, synchronizing the musical tones with the melodic lines and harmonies \ncreated by the khaen. To formulate practical examples of mawlum lyrics that can be applied in a \nmawlum performance to jazz composers, I would like to demonstrate two examples of such \nlyrics and their approximate pronunciation, as well as the translation of their meaning into \nEnglish, which I obtained from Terry Miller’s study.225  \n  \nSound in English: \ntook tee nah        nawng net nuang lai \nben bang took     sawat baman mee mua  \nkum huk ton       tu tang tua la tao \nmae hawt heang  hai mai mawt dam  \n \nMeaning in English:  \nEveryone’s tears are flowing  \nFor it is a time of great sorrow.  \nLove floods the mother's heart;  \nShe feels so sad that she would like to die. \n \nThe categories of mawlum are also diverse, as the style evolved through oral tradition in different \nprovinces of northeast Thailand. To accurately demonstrate this diversity, I have selected the \nillustrations contributed by Chaweewan Dumnern, who is an expert in mawlum performance \nand one of the most respected mawlum singers in northeast Thailand. According to Dumnern’s \npractical explanation in her seminar at the Sangkeet Sin Center226, mawlum is separated into four \n                                                        \n225 Miller, “Kaen Playing and Mawlum Singing in Northeast Thailand,” 39-40. \n226 Chaweewan Dumnern and Tongkam Taikla, “the Sangkeet Sin Center Vol 615, mawlum- mawkhaen.” \n",

Later on, she demonstrates the \nuse of lai (modes) performed by the khaen, whose melodic lines and accompaniments must \ncorrespond and interact with each other and the vocal parts. For instance, when performing \nmawlum klon, the use of modes to accompany the vocal is divided into three types—namely, the \nuse of lai thang san, the C, F, G major pentatonic scales for a short performance (lum thang san) \nwhich contains faster tempos, and lai thang yai (A, D, E) for a longer performance with a slow \ntempo, in which the vocalist sings longer poems. Meanwhile, for lum teay performances, which \nare classified into four types that are mainly used for entertainment (i.e., teay tammada, teay burma, \nteay khong, and teay hua node tan [เต้ยหัวโนนตาล]), the accompanying player (khaen) will perform \nmelodic patterns that are musically related to the vocalist’s parts. \n \nThe employment of Buddha’s teachings, the Jataka Tales, and other folklore, is also observed \nin the performance of mawlum ruang, which requires additional mawlum players to perform \ndifferent characters, in a similar way to a theatrical performance setting. The application of lai \nto accompany this performance may be varied and depends on the story that was chosen. The \nname of mawlum ruang is also referred to as mawlum moo, when performed by a group of people. \nAs for the mawlum phithikam, it can be referred by to other names, e.g., mawlum slong (inspection), \nor mawlum phi fa; this performance is practiced alongside traditional beliefs whose purpose is to \ncure illness. Here, the khaen player accompanies the vocal section by performing lai yai, and the \nmawlum invites the local spirits to possess their bodies by using poetic lyrics. The mawlum player \nmay also dance around the patients to investigate and later reveal to the patient’s family the \nsickness of the patient and how to cure it. The final category of mawlum performance, explained \nby Chaweewan in her seminar, concerns the practice of mawlum bettalet, which is related to \ndistinctive regional singing methods. For instance, two distinct styles of vocal melodic lines—\nconsisting of the singing techniques of phu tai phukao (which is located in the Phu Phan \nmountain range) and phu tai yai isan (located near the Mekong River)—can be performed by \nusing different regional accents, and the expressions assumed when singing may refer to the \ncharacter of the region’s people. \n \n4.6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  \n \nIsan nuea music is the musical culture of north-east Thailand’s upper region, which comprises \nfourteen provinces with Thai-Lao communities.

    "124": " \nCHAPTER 4:  Investigating the Musical Aspects of dontri isan nuea \n \n \n108 \nthis region is the khaen that can be used as a solo or accompaniment instrument. When \nperforming khaen, isan nuea musicians make the sound of drones, which is one of the region’s \nmost distinctive musical elements. Isan nuea musicians also employ the concept of lai to create \nmusic or produce a spontaneous improvisation. Aside from this meaning of lai, which refers \nto the sound of traditional modes, this word can also relate to the name of traditional music, \nas well the name of a regional music accent.  \n \nUnlike Thai classical music, several isan nuea instruments appear to have adopted the use of \nWestern instruments tuning known as sieng sakon, which can be more effective when \ntranscribed using a keyboard. The transcription of Sombat Simlah’s khaen performance led us \nto the results that isan nuea music is typically constructed using intervallic techniques within the \nkey. In addition, the use of question-and-answer methods similar to those used in jazz \nimprovisation, as well as chords produced by combining drone sounds and pentatonic scales, \nwhich are equivalent to a suspended chord in jazz harmony, give isan nuea music a homophonic \ntexture that sets it apart from Thai classical music. \n \nThamnong kern, thamnong lak, and thamnong yoi are three distinct sections used in isan nuea \nperformances, as Sombat Simlah’s transcription demonstrated. Buahong Phajung Lamut \nSapphat and Boomma Kaowong’s performances reveal that while performing isan nuea \nmusicians frequently emphasize the rhythmic accents on the upbeat, comparable to a swing \nfeel. Three traditional melodies, “Lai Lom Phat Phrao,” “Lai Nok Sai Bin Kham Thung,” and \n“Lai Teay Khong,” whose melodic construction is based on pentatonic scales which are also \ncapable of combing with contemporary jazz harmony, particularly the latter composition, \nwhich can be integrated with Coltrane’s chord progression, “Countdown.” As a result, my \narrangement of “Lai Teay Khong” is able to express both memorable isan nuea melodies as well \nas distinct jazz chord progressions. Other rhythms used in jazz compositions, such as hip hop, \nLatin, and 5/4 odd times, also effectively interweave with isan nuea traditional melodies. Isan \nnuea modes, such as lai yai, and lai sutsanaen can be employed in jazz compositional process to \naccentuate the character of isan nuea music during the improvisational section as the preliminary \nworks reveal.\n",

    "126": " \nCHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  \n \n \n110 \nTHE TRADITIONAL MUSIC OF SOUTHERN THAILAND (DONTRI PAKTAI) \n \nLocated on the Malay Peninsula, southern Thailand functions as a bridge between the \nAndaman Sea (bordering the Indian Ocean) and the Gulf of Thailand (which connects to the \nSouth China Sea). This location has played a role in the richness of the musical cultures of the \npeople of southern Thailand, which stem from the multicultural practices influenced by the \nactivities of maritime trade and religious exchange in the area. In this region, two distinct types \nof traditional music have been practiced for many generations, both integrated with the \nreligions of its people: the musical culture of Thai Mahayana Buddhists, and the musical culture \nof Thai Muslims.227 Among the numerous musical styles of these two communities, I examine \nonly two traditional music customs for the purposes of this study: nora, a musical \naccompaniment of the theatrical performances by Thai Mahayana Buddhists; and rong ngeng, the \nmusic culture that accompanies traditional Thai-Mulism dances. \n \n5.2 NORA \n \nThere are two main hypotheses about the origins of the traditional practice of nora or manora \n(in the dialect of central Thailand). One hypothesis is promoted by prince Damrong \nRajanubhab, a pioneering Thai historian who believed that this traditional practice may have \nbeen influenced by a similar theatrical performance style founded during the Ayutthaya period \nknown as lakhon chatri. This hypothesis is based on ancient scripts referring to homages to nora \nteachers (bot wai khru), groups of nora troupes who came to Ayutthaya to learn this performance \nstyle and brought it back to southern Thailand.228 The other hypothesis is that this traditional \nculture was originally developed in southern Thailand (presumably in Phattahalung Province) \nand significantly evolved in this particular area—and it only later influenced theatrical \nperformance practices in central Thailand.229 \n \nMuch like with other histories of traditional cultures based on oral tradition, to find the actual \nanswer to this question may depend on personal beliefs and local customs. As such, it may still \n                                                        \n227 Other than these two musical traditions, music practices in this region include Talung (shadow play music), \nKalor (funeral music), Li mont, and Toa Khurm (ritual music), and Silat (martial arts music) See more, \nSumrongthong, Southern Music: Artists, Knowledge Transfer Rituals and beliefs, (CU Press), 2011. \n228 Katawut Promli, “Pi nora Performance Technique of Khru Umnad Nuniad,” Master’s thesis, Chulalongkorn \nUniversity (2009), 36-37. \n229 Chuitka Kosonhemmanee, “The Development of Nora of Khun Oupbhathamnarakorn Family (Pum \nDheva),” Master’s thesis, Chulalongkorn University (2010), 11-18. \n",
    "127": " \nCHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  \n \n \n111 \nbe difficult to obtain the exact answer as to the origins of nora performance. However, in a \npractical sense—and from the perspective of empirical observation—the performance of nora \nindeed has a deep connection with the spirit of southern Thailand, through its dialects, beliefs, \nand customs, which can be especially observed in Phattahalung, Nakhon Si Thammarat, \nSongkhla, and Trang Provinces. In these areas, the musical performances authentically project \nthe character of the traditional culture of southerners, which is quite distinct from other \ntraditional practices in Thailand. The purpose of nora practices is also divided into two \ncategories which are employed in both formal ceremonies and for entertainment. The formal \ncategory is recognized as nora rong khru230, and is purposely practiced for communicating \nancestries, healing illness, and worshipping local spirits. \n \nPI NORA \n \nUnderstanding the musical practices employed to accompany nora performances begins with \nthe fundamental concepts of the instruments and techniques used in nora musical ensembles. \nThe pi nora is a reed instrument similar in appearance to the pi nai used in Thai classical music \nensembles, but is slightly smaller. The tuning system of the pi nora produces seven diatonic \npitches per octaves over a range of approximately 2 octaves. These pitches are B, C, D, E, F, \nG, A, B ­, C­, D,­ E,­, F ­, G­, A­,  B­­ C­­, D­­ in the standard model (42 cm).  Similar \nto isan nuea instruments, some pi nora adapt the Western tuning system, which allows a pi nora \nplayer (also known as nai pi nora in southern dialect) to perform with Western musical \ninstruments, especially with accompanying instruments such as keyboards, which are recently \nemployed in nora performances. In contrast to the homophonic texture of isan nuea produced \nby the khaen and phin, or the idiomatic heterophony and polyphonic stratification produced by \nThai classical music ensembles, the musical texture of nora music seems to be largely \nmonophonic in texture, with the pi nora acting as the only instrument to produce significant \nmelodic lines of the nora musical ensemble.231 For this reason, understanding how the pi nora \nfunctions in nora performances is crucial for jazz composers who are interested in this particular \nstyle of music.   \n                                                        \n230 There are two types of nora rong khru: 1.) nora rong khru yai (spending 3 days and 2 nights), and nora rong khru \nyai lek (taking 1 day and 1 night), which are generally held from March to September, with the ceremony starting \nbetween Wednesday and Friday. For more, see the Provincial Cultural office of Songkhla, Ministry of Culture, \nThailand. <https://www.m-culture.go.th/songkhla/ewt_news.php?nid=445&filename=index> (7 May 2017). \n231 I exclude the musical pitches that are produced by the mong (a set of two gong bells) which function as a \nrhythmic indicator (from a southern Thai musician’s perspective), more than contributing the necessary melodic \nmovement to nora ensembles. More details on the mong are later described in this chapter. \n",
    "128": " \nCHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  \n \n \n112 \nKHEUN HUA PI TECHNIQUE \n \nOne of the prominent instrumental techniques of the pi nora that can be observed in nora \nperformances is known as kheun hua pi (ขึEนหัวปี6), in which a pi nora player establishes the proper \nnumber of solo sections at the beginning of performances (a solo introduction). To perform \nthis technique, the nai pi nora starts by repeating a single pitch, gradually increasing the tempo, \nsimilar to tremolo effects on a lower pitch of a wind instrument which may be heard in jazz. \nThis usually starts on D, before adding musical ornaments, such as trills or upper and lower \nmordents, in the lower register, before gradually ascending to a high pitch (which usually is a \nhigh D), before descending to the low pitch again. This is an example of the characteristic \ncomplex sound of the pi nora. \n \nTo further illustrate the khuen hua pi technique, I have transcribed a performance of the nora \nmusic ensemble from Songkhla Rajabhat University in Songkhla Province, southern Thailand \n(Figure 5.1)232, considered one of the outstanding nora music ensembles in the southern region. \nIn mm.1-2, the nai pi nora performs a rapid repetition of the pitch D, before using the pattern \nof sixteenth and thirty-second notes—primarily consisting of the notes D and F—in mm.4-5 \nto introduce a new set of repeated pitches an ascension to the new target pitch—the note A in \nm.12. Later on, in m.13, the application of trills from A to B can also be examined as a new set \nof two repetitive pitches, which then approach the note G in m.14. Afterwards, from mm.19-\n28, the melodic repetitive patterns undulate, primarily including the pitches of G, D, A, B—\nwith the B note observable as the highest note in these patterns which eventually transfers to \nthe higher note, F#, in m.30.  \n \nThe melodic lines of this example of khuen hua pi technique also gradually ascend, to repeatedly \nreference the pitch B (m.32), and later reach the high D (m. 35)— the highest pitch capable of \nbeing produced by the standard model of the pi nora. After reaching this highest pitch, the pi \nnora plays descending melodic patterns to the new lower target pitches, including the note of \nF# in mm.38-41, the note of D in m.42, the pitch of A in m.45, the pitch of E in m.48, before \n                                                        \n232 Figure 5.1 was transcribed from the performance of the nora music ensemble from Songkhla Rajabhat \nUniversity (0.00-1.03) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO6_pkO3wZk> uploaded by Kon Dontri, (27 \nJune 2019). Please note that I excluded the application of tremolo and ornament signs to demonstrate the pitch \nlevels and rhythmic notation to resemble the original performance as much as possible. The utilization of khuen \nhua pi technique also may be slightly varied based on the regional influences and distinct teaching methods.  \n",

This instrumental technique operates as the introductory \nmusic of a nora performance to draw the audience’s attention, and it is placed within a longer \noverture section known as thon homrong. The utilization of drum rolls, the repetitive ching \npatterns, and the two distinct, constant sounds produced by two gong bells are also employed \nto rhythmically accompany this short introductory section created by pi nora techniques. \n                                                        \n233 Appendix C.10 contains a transcription MIDI. \n",

Therefore, thap \nwas [the] only instrument used to accompany singing, acting, or playing for both nora and nang \ntalung.”234 \n \nThere are a variety of techniques in playing the thap. The nai thap (a thap player) uses the hands \nto hit the drumheads in various locations, producing four distinct sounds from the instrument: \n1) chap or pap, a treble tone produced by striking the right hand to the center nuay chap (a higher-\ntone drum) while using the left hand to mute the sound at the hollow part of the tail of the \nsame drum; 2) tik, a treble tone (lower than chap) produced by a similar process to chap, except \nthe player employs the right-hand hit at the edge of the drumhead instead of the center; 3) \nthoeng (เทิง), which is a bass tone produced by a thap player using both the left and right hand to \nhit the center of both drums; and lastly 4) tid, a bass tone created by a similar method to thoeng, \nbut here, the nai thap concentrates on producing more bass tones with the right hand compared \nto the thoeng sound.235 \n \nKLONG, MONG, AND CHING \n \nOther musical instruments of nora musical ensembles that I have found to have potential use \nin musical hybridization projects include: 1) klong (known as klong charti in the central Thai \naccent), 2) mong (referred to as khong khu in the central Thai dialect), and 3) ching. The klong is a \ndrum similar to the klong thad (large bass drums) used in Thai classical music ensembles. \nHowever, the size of the klong used in the nora ensemble is much smaller than the klong thad \nand is performed with only one drum—in contrast to klong thad, which consists of two types \nof drum known as klong thad tua phu (a male drum) and klong thad tua mia (a female drum). The \nsound of the klong is produced by using a pair of drum sticks; this produces low bass tones and \n                                                        \n234 Kuan Tuanyok, The Accompanying Songs for The Traditional Performances of Southern Thailand, (Songkhla: The \nOffice of Arts and Cultural studies, Songkhla Rajabhat University 2014), 1-3. \n235 Kanokwan Khwanyuen, “Tap Playing Style of Nai Tap Sommai Laongsom in Nora Performance,” Journal of \nCommunity Development Research Neresuan University 9, no.2, (2015), 194-201.  \n",

Common drum techniques in klong rhythmic patterns include drum rolls and \nplaying around the edge of the drum with sticks to produce a more wooden sound.  \n \nThe purpose of the mong (a set of two gong bells) in nora ensembles can be divided into two \ncategories: 1) using the mong to operate as a rhythmic indicator or timekeeper, and 2) producing \nthe tuning pitches for nora dancers when they are required to sing lyrics (which primarily consist \nof Buddha’s teachings, paying homage to teachers, descriptions of their postures, or improvised \nrhymes to entertain the audience).236 The mong sound consists of two separate sounds in \ndescending perfect fifths; for example, a mong in D produces a D for the higher pitch, and a G \nfor the lower pitch. The mong player (nai mong) provides alternating sounds of D, G, D, G to \nindicate continuous time for nora ensembles. Alternatively, the instrument can be performed \nonly as D or G, or it can be rearranged to a different pattern of the two notes (e.g., D, D, D, \nG) based on the type of composition accompanying the nora dancers while performing. In \naddition, the ching—which consists of undamped and damped sounds, similar to Thai classical \nmusic—is also be played by mong players by using their one hand to hold a gong mallet and \ntheir other to play a ching instrument attached to a box that contains a set of two gong bells. \nPlease also note that the tuning of the mong is also variable and based on the individual \ncharacters of nora ensembles. In my observations, the tunings in D and E♭ occur widely when \ntranscribing nora music, and the tuning in E can be often observed in a different kind of \ntraditional performance known as nang talung (a shadow puppet play).  \n \nAn example of typical rhythmic patterns implemented in nora performances is illustrated in \nFigure 5.2, my transcription of a nora dance called rum nora sip-song bot (twelve dance postures) \nperformed by Tammanit Nikomrat, a nora expert from Songkhla Province who currently \nteaches nora performance at Thaksin University in Songkhla Province. Tammanit is well-known \nto both local and international audiences and is also renowned as an inventive nora performer \nwho has incorporated this style of southern Thai performance with other traditional \nperformances that may be seen in other parts of southern Thailand.237 I selected four rhythmic \nelements of the performance for musical analysis.

The second example is a rhythmic synchronization between the patterns of \nthap and klong that contributes a solid rhythmic sense to the nora dancer, which can be seen in \nmultiple instances. Based on my observations of these thap patterns, I discovered that the \nrespective chap and thoeng sounds play a critical role in accompanying the nora dancer, and the \napplication of the thoeng sound in the second downbeat (as illustrated by the letter “T”) provides \nstrong rhythmic accents for the performance.  \n \nThe third example displays the consistent rhythmic patterns of a set of two gongs sounded in \nE♭ and A♭, with the ching patterns emphasizing every downbeat also functioning as a time \nindicator.

Unlike khaen \nperformances of isan nuea music, which are constructed by using several interval patterns, the \nmelodic patterns in “Chak Bai,” a southern Thai composition, appear to be based on stepwise \nmotions with the wide skip interval evident only in m.6.  \n \nSimilar to the melody of “Chak bai,” the melodic construction of “Patcha,” as performed in \nUmnad Nuniad’s version, is also based on the C major pentatonic scale, with the note G used \nat the beginning and end of its several musical phrases, and D at the end. Applying the same \nmethod of jazz analysis of Chapter 3, the fundamental patterns of this composition are also \nbased on G-A-C-D-E (5-6-1-2-3) and E-G-A-C (3-5-6-1), both of which can be found in \nseveral locations throughout the performance. Furthermore, the melody of “Patcha” is also \nmade up of a combination of several short motifs in quarter-note rhythms, and the repetition, \nsuch as C-C, D-D-, E-E, and G-G can be utilized to intertwine its musical phrases together. \n \n5.3 A PROTOTYPE COMPOSITION \n \nBy working with these three musical elements in jazz composition, I was able to compose the \ncontemporary jazz piece “Manora,” which musically expresses the sound of nora performance \n(Figure 5.6). In the A section, I decided to manifest the specific character of the melody of \n“Patcha.” I did so by implementing some of the melodic motions from mm.1-16 of my \ntranscription of Umnad Nuniad to construct the bass part—performed by a keyboard in this \nsection. For the double bass part in the A section, I also composed a retrograde version of \nthese melodic lines. Together with the bass lines generated by the keyboard part, they produce \ncontrary motion, which contributes an interesting musical idea to the composition. For the B \nsection, I continued to examine the application of kheun hua pi techniques by utilizing the sound \nof a soprano saxophone to reference the sound of the pi nora. The traditional technique on pi \nnora was initially composed based on the pitch D—a similar sound to those of kheun hua pi \ntechniques, with the ascension to the higher pitches of the notes G and A. In addition, the \ndouble bass part of the B section also essentially imitates the perpetual sound of D alternating \nwith G, similar to the patterns created by mong players in nora ensembles.  \n \nMoving on to the compositional methods in the C section: here, I selected the memorable \nmelodic lines of “Patcha” and began to transform their original pitches, and rearrange the \nrhythmic structures from the transcription (starting from m.35), to accommodate the main \n",
    "140": " \nCHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  \n \n \n124 \nmelody section of “Manora.” To avoid the duplication of the melodic movement of the simple \nmelody, I also decided to employ the key modulation of the second repeat of the melody part. \nAnother noticeable musical element that I included in this composition is the “Sot Soi” pattern, \nin the E section. Because the characteristic sound of the “Soi Sot” pattern is simple, \nmemorable, and frequently heard when nora performers change their postures, implementing \nthis memorable melodic line can clearly signal the unique sound of nora performances to the \naudience. In the F section, I decided to include the melodic patterns for “Chak Bai,” which I \ntranscribed from Sirichai Vejkul’s performance and then transposed up a minor third. \nHowever, in this section—which contains no rhythmic adjustments—my aim was to provide \nthe sound of nora music with as minimal change as possible in order to balance compositional \npractices between traditional and modern aspects and render an accurate characterization of \nnora music to the audience. Indeed, working on blending these selected musical elements of \nnora music into a small jazz ensemble can provide me with practical methods, as well as \ngenerating more innovative compositional ideas that can be later utilized for musical \nhybridization in jazz orchestra writing.247  \n \n \n \nFigure 5.6a: “Manora.” Composed by the author. \n \n                                                        \n247 The full lead sheet of “Manora” is displayed in Appendix A.7. \n",

(continued) \n \n5.4 RONG NGENG  \n \nRong ngeng is one of several musical practices of Thai Muslims in southern Thailand. The origins \nof this style of music are both vibrant and fascinating, as Thai Muslim music can be interpreted \nas an exemplary case of the musical transculturation of Western, Arabic, and multiple local \ncultures in the Malay peninsula.248 As Prapad Krupradub states in his study “Rong Ngeng: Music \nand Folk Dance in the South of Thailand,” the origin of rong ngeng—which refers to a dancing \nstyle that may have been influenced by overseas traders, in particular the Portuguese, Spanish, \nDutch, and Arabs—can be also traced to the area around Java, before later moving to the Malay \npeninsula.249 As Lawrence N. Ross notes, “Rong ngeng is an old term that goes back to \nfourteenth-century Java, and has commonly stood, since that time, for some type of music \nensemble featuring a female singer-dancer—if not a term for the dancer, herself—throughout \n                                                        \n248 The modern national border between Thailand and Malaysia was formed as a result of the Anglo-Siamese \nTreaty in 1909, as previously stated in Chapter 3 (the modern Thai nation section).

David Goldsworthy states that \n \nThese authors’ extrapolations of rong ngeng to explain history all miss a crucial point: that regardless of \nconnections to early colonial contact rong ngeng is a more recent phenomenon whose roots lie primarily \nin transformations to early twentieth-century popular Malayan dance hall and theater music, rather than \nan archaic form perpetuated from earlier centuries. Not to discount connections with the older roots, \nbut recent history is more germane to what make rong ngeng distinctive.252 \n \nTan Sooi Beng, when discussing the origins of rong ngeng during the post-Portuguese period, \nhas referred to the ethnic diversity of rong ngeng troupes in Melaka, later emphasizing its peaks, \nwhich were comparable to the performance of Malay theaters: \n \nIt is believed that the ronggeng developed during the post-Portuguese period in Melaka, and ronggeng \ntroupes comprising performers of different ethnic origins still provide music and entertainment during \nMalay and Baba…And, folk ronggeng songs evolved into modern popular genres and were introduced to \nall parts of Malaya through bangsawan, the first urban commercial Malay theater. It evolved in the late \nnineteenth century and reached its peak prior to and during the Second World War—in the 1920s, 1930s, \nand early 1940s.253 \n \nAs previously indicated by these four researchers, whether rong ngeng performances originated \nin Java or the Malay Peninsula is still a source of debate. However, it is significant that this \nperformance is one of the musical traditions of Southeast Asian Muslim communities, which \nstill can be witnessed in the coastal cities across Java and the Malay Peninsula, as well as several \nprovinces in southern Thailand, of particular relevance to the aims of my composition \nproject.254 \n \nThe traditional practices of rong ngeng for both dancing and accompaniment in Thailand can be \ndivided into two geographical categories, namely, 1) the style of rong ngeng located in the \n                                                        \n250 Lawrence N.

And, similar to the northeast Thai \nmusic that can be also observed as the traditional music of Laos. Nevertheless, because my research focuses on \nmusical aspects of jazz compositions rather than sociocultural discussion. For this chapter, I will only consider \nthe example of rong ngeng, which has been practiced among Thai-Muslim communities. \n",
    "143": " \nCHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  \n \n \n127 \nsoutheast part of Thailand (the gulf of Thailand), which includes Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat \nProvinces, and 2) those rong ngeng performances by the Thai-Muslim communities along the \nAndaman coastline (southwest Thailand) (e.g., Satun, Phang-nga [พังงา], Krabi, and Trang \nprovinces, as well as Lanta and Li-pe islands).255 The distinctive performances of these two \ndifferent styles of rong ngeng can be observed in the selected instruments of the musical \nensembles, the postures of the dancers, and the original purpose of the performances.   \n \nThe origins of rong ngeng practice in the southeast part of Thailand, according to Prapad \nKrupradub, traces back to the musical entertainment of governors or sultans in this particular \narea (and, more specifically, to Phya Phiphit Senamad [พระยาพิพิธเสนามาตย์ฯ], a sultan of Yaring [ยะ\nหริ.ง], which is present-day Pattani Province).256 Later, this style spread to the communities \nthrough traditional Muslim theatrical performances known as mak yong (มะโย่ง) (which are related \nto nora performances). As a consequence, the practice of rong ngeng in this region significantly \nconcerns the meticulous posture of rong ngeng dancers (comprising both males and females), \nand the instruments used in this musical ensemble include Western instruments such as the \nviolin, mandolin, and accordion; both of these factors are evident in the practice of musical \ntranslation, as mentioned earlier. \n \nThe practice of rong ngeng in the southwest of Thailand can also be separated into two sub-\ncategories, consisting of rong ngeng chao le (rong ngeng of the chao le people [ชาวเล] and rong ngeng \ntanyoug [ตันหยง], concentrated in the Krabi Province and surrounding areas). Unlike the \nperformances of rong ngeng in the southeastern area, rong ngeng chao le and rong ngeng tanyoug were \noriginally practiced among the fishing communities and in villages along the coast of the \nAndaman Sea. Therefore, most of the performances in this style include lyrics that express the \nfisherman’s lifestyle, sea lullabies, and ordinary stories of village-style courtships; these lyrics \nare occasionally generated by improvisational processes of vocalists (klon sot). In addition, the \nmusical instruments employed in the rong ngeng performances of southwest Thailand seem to \nbe fewer in number—consisting only of the violin, two different sizes of a frame drum called \nrebana257 (or rammana, in the central-Thai dialect), and one gong—compared to the rong ngeng \nmusical ensembles of the southeastern part of the country.  \n                                                        \n255 Mesri, A Case Study of Rong Ngang songs of Mr. Seng Arboo, 16. \n256 Krupradub, “Rong Ngeng: Music and Folk Dance in the South of Thailand,” 61. \n257 Please also note that there are several different rebana models employed in various traditional music styles in \nsouth Thailand. The rebana type referred to in rong ngeng performances in both the southeast and west is a single \ndrum head that sizes around 25 to 60 centimeters, and traditionally made of goat and cow skins.

    "144": " \nCHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  \n \n \n128 \nAnother striking difference in the performance methods between these two regional rong ngeng \nstyles (southeastern and southwestern) concerns the practice of wai khru ceremonies (paying \nhomage to teachers). Nevertheless, such ceremonies can only be investigated in rong ngeng chao \nle and rong ngeng tanyong performances where the musicians perform a “Lagu Dua”(ลาฆูดูวอ) (for \nrong ngeng tanyoung) and “Lagu Du Wa (ลาฆูดูวา)” (for rong ngeng chao le) to pay the local spirits for \nprotection.258 (Please also note that different dance postures, costumes, and slightly different \ndialects are observable in the respective performances of rong ngeng chao le and rong ngeng \ntanyong.) \n \nMUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND TEXTURE  \n \nThe rong ngeng musical ensembles in the southeast, as previously indicated, include several \nWestern instruments, such as mandolin and accordion, that can be used to create harmony. As \na result, the musical texture of rong ngeng in the region is identifiable in its homophony—which \nis similar to isan nuea music but differs from Thai classical music and nora performances, as well \nas the rong ngeng performances of the southwest region (tanyoug and chao le), which only use one \nviolin. The primary function of the violin in rong ngeng musical ensembles (for both regions) is \nsimilar to its purpose in other traditional music styles of Europe, the Americas and elsewhere, \nserving to execute main melodic lines. Another technique of Thai rong ngeng violinists which is \nsimilarly identifiable in Western classical music, as well as in a number of traditional and \nclassical music styles, is the use of the double stop. The use of the accordion and mandolin \napplies to only to southeast rong ngeng ensembles, and is intended to support violinists primarily \nby constructing unisons or octave unisons in the melodic lines of rong ngeng compositions. Other \nfundamental accompaniment techniques—such as playing intervals or triads—are also \nfrequently observable in the performances of the accordion and mandolin. \n \nThe percussion instruments used in rong ngeng performances in southern Thailand can also be \ndivided into two categories, by region. In general, southwestern rong ngeng performances use \nfewer percussion instruments than southeastern rong ngeng performances. In both regions, rong \nngeng performances usually feature two sizes of the rebana (rammana), a larger drum for the \n                                                        \nLawrence N.

Both regions also feature one unpitched gong (or khong \nin the central-Thai dialect) in rong ngeng performances, utilized to emphasize the downbeats.  \n \nIn contrast to rong ngeng performances in the southwest, the percussion instruments in \nsoutheastern ensembles include additional percussion instruments such as maracas and the \ntambourine. Because of these larger instrumentations of southeastern ensembles, and my \ninterest in musical texture, I decided that for this project, I would provide one concise \nillustration of a performance from the southeastern region’s style. This example was taken from \nAtipon Anukool’s research on southeastern rong ngeng performances.259 The Ussakmeemala \nensemble, one of the most well-known rong ngeng groups from Pattani Province in the southeast, \nperformed this piece, a composition called “Oh Sa Loma” (Figure 5.7).260 (Please note that \nwhile transcribing or studying rong ngeng compositions, the use of a 2/4 time signature is avoided \ndue to the lack of perpetual beats generated by the ching, which are often heard in other \ntraditional Thai music styles.) \n  \nFigure 5.7a:  Selection from “Oh Sa Loma” by Atipon Anukool, an example of the \nmusical texture of southeastern rong ngeng.  \n \n                                                        \n259 Anukool, “Rong- Ngang Song of Ussaleemala,”76. \n260 Ibid.,76.  \n",

In addition, the accordion player \ncarries additional responsibility for producing fundamental harmonies to rong ngeng musical \ntextures (e.g., employing simple triadic voicings). The mandolin players in rong ngeng ensembles \neither play an accompaniment role by performing certain intervals (typically the interval of a \nthird) or melodic lines in unison with the violin players, as is demonstrated in the second \nending. In a standard setting, the rhythm sections of southeastern rong ngeng ensembles may \nconsist of three players—with the sounds of the gong and maracas performed by the one \npercussionist and serving to signify the downbeat accents. The sound of the rebana also \nconstructs perpetual rhythmic patterns that signify and guide the distinguished stylistic \nrhythmic patterns used in rong ngeng performance. To provide complicated rhythmic ideas—in \nparticular, to create syncopated rhythms—rong ngeng ensembles also add one more percussion \nplayer on luk kut to create a syncopated character against rabana patterns, as seen in the \ntranscription.  \n \nRHYTHMIC PATTERNS \n \nIn the southeastern and southwestern genres of rong ngeng, rhythmic patterns are performed in \na number of ways. Tan Sooi Beng has explained the application of Malay words to symbolize \nthe two dissimilar sounds that are constructed by the rebana, namely tak (treble sounds), and \n",
    "147": " \nCHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  \n \n \n131 \ndung (bass sounds).261 This is similar to Lawrence N. Ross’s demonstration that the word dung \nrefers to a center stroke produced by the low sound, while tak denotes the high timbre \nproduced by striking the player’s hand against the edge of the instrument. In addition, Ross \nalso mentions that the word duk may apply to the muted treble sound similar to tak, but here, \nthe rebana player uses one hand to mute the drum skin.262 Adapting this significant rhythmic \ninformation can provide jazz composers with a better understanding of rebana performances \nand also develop the practical concept of rhythmic patterns performed in both types of rong \nngeng performance. However, due to regional accents and the diverse dialects that may differ \nbetween Muslims in Thailand and Malaysia, I have decided to, in my rebana transcriptions, use \ntwo percussion lines where the top line refers to the treble sound and the bottom line refers to \nthe bass tone. The “x”, meanwhile, designates the muted sounds, in order to substantially \nreduce any confusion around the letters used in my method. \n \nTo provide demonstrations of the rhythmic patterns of rong ngeng music practiced in Muslim \ncommunities in Thailand, I selected performances of a rong ngeng troupe from Satun Province263 \n(tanyong in the southwestern region), whose performers are from the Faculty of Fine Arts of \nSongkla Rajabhat University, led by Jansamorn Pholboon.264 Additionally, this performance \nwas a subject of a qualitative study conducted using the documentary method and the field \nsurvey approach, which included interviewing, observing, and learning from a local rong ngeng \ntroupe. The three fundamental rhythmic patterns, which were transcribed from the rebana \nperformance, are called lagu dua (ลาฆูดูวอ), mak inang (มะอินัง), and sinadong (สินาโด้ง) (Figure 5.8).265 \n  \nFigure 5.8a: Fundamental rhythmic patterns of rong ngeng tanyong.

This rhythmic pattern is also made up of three groups of treble tones and two groups \nof bass sounds, with the accentuated beat appearing on the second and fourth beats, which is \ninterestingly comparable to beats typically accented in many styles of jazz. Throughout the \nperformance, it is also performed in triplet pulse. The rhythmic patterns of the rebana employed \nin “Mak Inang” and “Sinadong” also include syncopated sixteenth-note rhythms. Muted \ntechniques are evident in both of these rhythmic patterns. Interestingly, the accentuation of \nMak Inang is comparable to Laga dua, with the second and fourth beats again corresponding to \nemphases on beats 2 and 4 in many 4/4 jazz styles. “Sinadong” rhythmic patterns also feature \nsyncopated beats produced by a set of two notes in treble tones and a group of three notes in \nbass tones, with the accented beats placed on the initial downbeat. This rhythmic pattern can \nof course be applied to drum set or congas parts, as I later explain in the discussion of my jazz \norchestra compositional process (Chapter 7). \n \nFor examples of rhythmic patterns of rong ngeng performances in southeastern Thailand, I \nselected for transcription rebana patterns which have been analyzed by Apicha Kantacha in an \nacademic forum on “Ronggeng community people in Songkhla” hosted by Prince of Songkhla \nUniversity in Songkhla Province.

To provide more \nsyncopated rhythmic ideas, the rebana player also performs the second sixteenth-note up-beats \nin the bass tone in the second group of patterns.

It seems that the slow inang is less syncopated in its rhythm than \nthe Asli pattern. The fast inang includes syncopated rhythms on the upbeats of the second and \nfourth beats. The rhythmic pattern of the fast inang is also similar to the rhythmic pattern that \naccompanies “Sinadong” in southwestern rong ngeng performances, but with different beats \nemphasized. \n \nThe final rhythmic pattern that I transcribed is joget, which is one of the most famous stylistic \nrhythmic patterns in rong ngeng performances in the southeastern region, and perhaps in other \nareas as well. Apicha explains that the origin of this particular rhythm could be associated with \nthe traditional dances of the Portuguese. Nowadays, the joget rhythm is famously employed in \nMuslim wedding ceremonies. In addition, the noticeable musical elements in this particular \nrhythm include a set of sixteenth-notes connected to two eighth-notes—which are accented in \nthe first down-beats and the second up-beats without any rests. \n \nRONG NGENG COMPOSITIONS \n \nThe musical compositions of rong ngeng performances in Thai-Muslim communities have also \nbeen significantly influenced by Malay folk and film music. Seng Arboo, one of the prominent \nrong ngeng musicians from Pattani province, mentions that some of the musical compositions \nthat he uses to accompany southeastern rong ngeng performances are drawn from Malay folk \nmusic he listened to in his childhood, which he later interpreted and adopted to suit his \nperformances.268 The compositional repertoire of rong ngeng music played in the southwestern \nregion can also be divided into two categories: 1) compositions significantly influenced by \nMalay folk music during the Second World War, and 2) compositions that contain Thai lyrics \nresulting from the separation of Malay and Thai cultures in the post-war era.269 \n \nAlthough rong ngeng compositions are relatively new when compared to Thai classical and isan \nnuea music, its performance practices have been strongly maintained through oral transmission \nbetween the different generations of Thai Muslim communities in southern Thailand. In \nparticular, rong ngeng performances in southeastern Thailand went through a process of \n                                                        \n268 Mesri, “A Case Study of Rong Ngang songs of Mr. Seng Arboo,”37.  \n269 Ross, “Rong Ngeng The Transformation of Malayan Social Dance Music in Thailand Since The 1930s,”234. \n",

To provide a rhythmic character related to the social dances of the rong ngeng \nperformance, I also made use of the rhythmic patterns of bolero which are performed by the \ndrum, bass, and piano players in the E section. In addition, the melody of this part was a \nreharmonization of the original melody of the Lenang composition that is frequently \nperformed in southeast Thailand as a piece of slow dance music. As a result, this melody is \n",

Pi nora, thap, \nklong, mong, and ching are some of the instruments utilized in nora music, with nai pi (a reed player) \nplaying a significant role in creating the fundamental melodic lines used in nora music. One of \nthe prominent instrumental techniques of pi nora that is capable of being imitated by a soprano \nsaxophone is khuen hua pi, which is a single pitch reiteration that begins with lower pitches and \nprogresses to higher notes before returning to lower pitches. Another important musical \ncharacteristic of this traditional music can be linked to the two mong sounds, such as D and G, \nwhich can be constantly heard alternating throughout nora performances and replicated in bass \nlines, as shown in my prototype composition. The use of nora repertoires has also been linked \nto Thai classical music musical performance repertoires. Unlike the melodies of isan nuea music \nperformances, which are predominantly constructed by using intervallic patterns, the melodic \npatterns of southern Thai compositions tend to be based on stepwise motions, as illustrated in \nthe transcriptions of “Patcha,” and “Chak Bai.” \n \nAnother traditional Thai southern music performance is a rong ngeng performance, which is a \nmusical practice of southern Thai Muslims. Unlike other Thai musical traditions, rong \nngeng performance incorporate the use of western instruments such as the violin and accordion. \nTwo distinct regional styles, rong ngeng (tanyoug) in the southwest and rong ngeng in the southeast, \nare distinguished by the instrument, repertoires, and performance methods. The rhythmic \npattern of rong ngeng’s music, which construed by rebana is one of the most intriguing features \nthat can be utilized in jazz composition. These rhythmic patterns can be effectively executed \nby drums, bongo, and conga in jazz ensembles, or employed as rhythmic accompaniments for \ndrum solo as demonstrated in my prototype composition. The southwestern region’s rong ngeng \nmusic compositional repertoire can also be classified into two categories: 1) compositions \ninfluenced by Malay folk music; 2) compositions with Thai lyrics and adaptations of Thai \ncultures as a result of the separation of Malay and Thai cultures in the postwar era. In addition, \nMalay folk and film music have had a significant influence on rong ngeng repertoires in the \nsoutheast. Importantly, the melodic lines of rong ngeng compositions contain half-step intervals \nand highlight the sound of a harmonic minor scale, which is dissimilar to the concept of “penta-\ncentric” in dontri thai doem (Thai classical music) and isan nuea music. \n",

    "158": " \nCHAPTER 6: Exploring the Musical Components of dontri paknuea \n \n \n142 \nTHE TRADITIONAL MUSIC OF NORTHERN THAILAND (DONTRI \nPAKNUEA) \n \nThe traditional music of northern Thailand, known as “Lanna Music,”276 is the musical practice \nof northern Thais who reside in the region’s mountain ranges and valleys, bordering Laos to \nthe east and Myanmar to the west. Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Lampang, Lamphun, Mae Hong \nSon, Phayo, Phrea, Nan, and some regions of Uttaradit Province are among the nine provinces \nwhere traditional northern Thai music is still performed in modern-day Thailand.277 The \nprominent musical performances of this particular genre of traditional music can be divided \ninto four different types278: 1) the practices of female and male singers (khap saw) accompanied \nby a musical ensemble of free-reed bamboo pipes (wong pi jum); 2) instrumental and \naccompanying music performed by northern string instruments in ensembles called salo, saw, \nand sueng in Chiang Mai (called salo, saw, and pin in Nan); 3) performances of klong sabat chai and \nklong luang drum ensembles for sacred and religious ceremonies, klong mong soeng drum \nensembles for accompanying traditional northern dances (fon), and klong puje drum ensembles, \nwhich accompany the northern martial arts (fon dap); and lastly 4) the performances of pi phat \nLanna musical ensembles (also known as pad, pad-gong, pad nae) which are slightly similar to pi \nphat ensembles of Thai classical music, but which employ different instruments, including \ndrums called klong teng thing (กลองเต่งถึEง) and klong pong pong (กลองป่งโป้ง), as well as double-reed \ninstruments known as nae luang (แนหลวง) and nae noi (แนน้อย). In addition, the traditional pi phat \nLanna repertoire consists of both Thai classical compositions and compositions of northern \nThailand.279 \n \n                                                        \n276 The word “Lanna” is also associated with other subjects—including the name of the ancient kingdom of the \nnorthern people, the primary influential language of northerners, and the historical period of the northern part of \nThailand. Wyatt, Thailand: A Short History, 33. \n277 It is also important to recognize that these nine provinces were once part of the Lanna Kingdom, which was \ngreatly influenced by the Lan Xang kingdom (Laos), in particular during the reign of King Setthathirah (1534-\n1571), and were then ruled by Burmese during Toungoo and Konbaung dynasties from the 16th to the 18th \ncenturies, before being officially annexed to Siam territory during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (1868-1910). \n“Siam’s plan to seize Lanna” Nuaon Khrouthongkhieo, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences Suan Sunandha \nRajabhat University, Matichon TV <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j-aDZ7gmRw> (27 July 2019). \n278 Lanna music is also referred to as Khon Mueang music in urban areas. In addition, there are multiple musical \nperformances that belong to the hill tribes of northern Thailand. See, “The ethnic group research”, Princess Maha \nChakri Sirindhorn Anthropology Centre’s website <https://www.sac.or.th/> and Benjamin Stuart Fairfield, “The \nParticipatory We-Self: Ethnicity and Music in Northern Thailand,” PhD diss., University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa \n(2017).   \n279 Wuthipat Ketpattanaphon, “Knowledge of Wong Petchphayom, a Lanna piphat ensemble,” (Chiang Mai: \nCultural Arts Center of Maejo University 2011), 16-18. \n",
    "159": " \nCHAPTER 6: Exploring the Musical Components of dontri paknuea \n \n \n143 \nAmong the several traditional music practices of these nine provinces, distinctive regional \nperformances are also evident in terms of the utilization of different instruments, types of \nmusical ensembles, and singing dialects. To enable easier understanding of this concept of \nregional distinction, Thai ethnomusicologists such as Pornprasit (2006) and Sumrongthong \n(2006) divide the musical practices of this region into two dominant groups: the traditional \npractices primarily influenced by Chiang Mai province (Northwest), and the musical cultures \nmainly inspired by Nan province (Northeast).280 Two practices, one from each province, lend \nthemselves to the hybridization process of this project: 1) the traditional singing practice known \nas khap saw (from Chiang Mai Province), and 2) the instrumental compositions of salo and pin \nensembles from Nan Province.  \n \n6.2 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS  \n \nBefore providing a comprehensive discussion on the musical structures of northern Thai music \nthat I have drawn on in this project, it is important to start by discussing the traditional \ninstruments of this region relevant to this study, which can provide fundamental concepts of \nhow northern Thai musicians perform music. These instruments include: 1) pi jum (bamboo \npipe), 2) salo (two-stringed bowed fiddle), and 3) sueng or pin (plucked lute). \n \nPI JUM  \n \nThe word “pi jum” refers to the group of end-blown free reed bamboo pipe instruments (jum \nmeans “congregation” in Lanna dialect), consisting of five different sizes in pi jum ensembles. \nEach instrument has either six or seven finger holes. The individual instruments include pi koy \n(the main instrument, medium-sized), pi klang (for bass tones, medium-large), pi mae (for bass \ntones, the largest), pi lek (for treble tones, small), and pi tat (for treble tones, the smallest). Each \ninstrument in this group of bamboo pipes is capable of producing seven relatively diatonic \npitches similar to other bamboo instrument types used in Thai classical music or isan nuea music. \nThe tuning system of the pi jum family appear to utilize the Western tuning system (sieng sakon) \nof the present-day,281 and it can be also divided into five categories based on the size of \ninstruments, namely: 1) the pi koy system (in C), which starts from C(4)-D-E-F-G-A-B-C­ \n                                                        \n280 Pornprasit, The performances method of the traditional north Thailand music, 68.    \n281 This video was uploaded by Huan Green Music and demonstrated instruments from the pi jum family that \nused the Western tuning system <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqYsvZmdHQk> (24 June 2021). \n",

In addition, when performing as a musical ensemble, to \naccompany vocalists (khap saw), this group of instruments is also capable of forming into three \nstandard ensemble categories: 1) wong pi jum sam (three instruments), consisting of pi koy, pi \nklang, and pi lek; 2) wong pi jum si (four instruments), consisting of pi koy, pi klang, pi lek, and pi \nmae; and 3) wong pi jum ha (five instruments), including pi koy, pi klang, pi lek, pi mae, and pi tat. \nWhile performing together, pi jum ensembles are capable of producing a heterophonic texture \nbased on idiomatic interpretations of the of the principal melodies, which is part of the unique \nand characteristic sound of northern Thai traditional music, which I explain later in this \nchapter. \n \nSALO \n \nThe salo is a two-stringed fiddle that has historically been used by northern Thai musicians to \ngenerate the distinct characteristics and timbre of this style of music. The physical shape of the \nsalo seems to be smaller than other fiddle instruments in the Thai classical ensemble, namely, \nthe saw u, saw sam sai, and saw duang, and is consequently able to construct a brighter shining \ntone. There are three different salo sizes—large, medium, and small—and two different \nmodels282 that are distinctively employed in Chiang Mai and Nan Provinces, the regular salo \n(kom) and the salo kop. The difference in structure between these two models concern the size \nof the salo kop (use in Nan Province) (which is slightly bigger), and the barring of the “kop” on \nthe instrument’s neck (similar to guitar frets). In contrast, the salo kom (employed in Chiang \nMai Province) is a fretless instrument. The tuning concepts and systems of these two salo \n                                                        \n282 I exclude another salo model—which has a similar playing technique to a regular salo but employs a different \nbow placement—that is only utilized in Uttaradit Province. \n",
    "161": " \nCHAPTER 6: Exploring the Musical Components of dontri paknuea \n \n \n145 \nmodels can be diverse, as with the tuning system of phin. However, there are currently three \nmethods that are commonly used, including 1) the luk sam technique, which is frequently \nemployed for a small type of salo kom and in which the higher string is tuned in the sound of \nG, and the lower string to the note of C note (perfect 5th). This is the opposite tuning to 2) \nthe luk si technique in which the higher string is tuned to C and the lower string to G (perfect \n4th) (this is the preferred tuning for the medium-sized salo kom and salo kop type). Lastly, 3) in \na combination of luk sam and luk si tuning techniques for a large salo kom, the strings are tuned \nin C(low)–G(mid)–C(high).283 This large salo kom—or salo sam sai (three strings)—exists, but is \nrarely used in traditional northern Thai musical ensembles these days. The style’s melodic \nembellishments that are comparable to those used in jazz compositions include sliding pitches \n(rud sai in Thai), trills (phrom niu) (พรมนิ%ว), and mordents (sabat niu). These elements are \nprominently employed in salo performances, with Terry Miller writing that, “Northern Thai \nmusic is distinguished by the use of certain instruments unique to the region, the extensive and \ndistinctive ornamentation of melody, and the heterophonic texture of ensemble music.”284 \n \nSUENG \n \nThe sueng is another plucked lute instrument that is frequently employed in northern Thai \ntraditional ensembles. On this instrument, the group of four stings—which are constructed in \ndouble courses, similar to the oud—is installed over the neck of the instrument. Nowadays, \nthree different sizes and models of the sueng are widely performed, namely, sueng luang or sueng \nyai (the largest model, only used in some areas), the medium-sized sueng klang, and the small \nsueng lek.  These usually have a similar number of frets (nine in total), and are capable of \nproducing different timbres, from the lower tones of the larger model to the brighter tones of \nthe smaller model. Besides the differences in timbre, differences in the tuning of these models \ncan also be observed; for example, the luk si technique (similar to the salo tuning system) is \napplied to the sueng yai and sueng lek (where the lower string is tuned in G, and the higher string \nin C), as well as the sueng klang and sueng luang. The name sueng can also refer to a related lute \ninstrument called pin, which is played in Nan Province and is slightly larger, consisting of eleven \nto thirteen frets.  \n \n                                                        \n283 Pornprasit, The performance methods of traditional northern Thailand music, 86-85. \n284 Miller and Williams, The Garland Handbook of Southeast Asian Music, 167. \n",

The sueng’s primary function in northern Thai \nmusical ensembles is to emphasize the main melodic patterns that are principally performed by \nthe pi koy or salo, as well as to accommodate the stability of timing in the pi jum ensemble (in \nChiang Mai Province). To provide a practical example, I have transcribed the sueng performance \nof a prominent multi-instrumentalist, Panupat Apichanatong from Chiang Mai Province, in a \nwell-known northern Thai composition called “Saw Eue” (ซออือ).”285 Furthermore, Panupat is \nregarded as one of Thailand’s most outstanding contemporary Lanna musicians. His expertise \nin the construction of traditional Lanna instruments, particularly the sueng, was especially well-\nknown.

The phrase \nkhap saw in Lanna means “singing” and can be easily confused with saw—which refers to a type \nof fiddle instrument in the central-Thai dialect. The original practices of khap saw performances \nand their poetic lyrics are significantly associated with historical events—in particular, wars \nbetween the Lanna Kingdom and their neighbors, which were written in Phongsawadan Lanna \n(chronicles); the Buddhist tales (Jataka story); stories of romantic courtship between \nnortherners; or the ordinary stories of various ethnicities and hill tribes residing in the \nhighlands, such as Tai yai (ไทใหญ่), Karen (กระเหรี.ยง), and Hmong (ม้ง). \n \nIn the musical research of Bussakorn Sumrongthong, she explicitly categorizes khap saw \nperformances into two different groups: 1) saw ruang (singing performances describing a long \nstory) and 2) saw kio sao (ซอเกีEยวสาว)(spontaneous vocal performances by female and male singers \nthat reveal romantic relationships).288 When generating the poetic lyrics—through either pre-\ncomposed or improvised material—of khap saw performances, chang saw (vocalists) must strictly \nfollow by a pattern of stanzas consisting of four lines with a length of six to twelve syllables. \nIn addition, the melodic lines (thamnong) produced by singers must be musically synchronized \nwith the melodic movements constructed by the pi jum ensembles, which practically function \nas the musical accompaniment to khap saw performances.   \n \nOnly a few types of melodic patterns (thamnong) are considered traditional Lanna compositions, \nand used as the principal melodies for accompanying khap saw performances, are still used \ntoday. These are: 1) the melodic patterns performed in the northwestern region, such as \n“Thamnong Tang Chiang Mai” (overture)(ตั%งเชียงใหม่), “Japu,” “Lamai,” “Eue, (อือ)” “Phama \n(พม่า),” and “Ngiew (เงี%ยว)”; 2) the regional melodic patterns prominently employed in the \nnortheastern region, such as “Laplae (ลับแล)” and “Panfai” (used in northeast regions); and 3) \n“Long Nan (ล่องน่าน),” which is played in both the northeastern and northwestern regions.289   \nTo provide a practical example of the traditional melodic patterns (thamnong) in khap saw \nperformances, I have transcribed the comprehensive treatment of the melodic patterns in \n“Thamnong Ngiew” as performed by Inchan Muncharoen, a player of the pi koy (an instrument \n                                                        \n288 Bussakorn Sumrongthong, Thai Musical Culture: Its Belief and Ritual within the North Region of Thailand, (Bangkok: \nChulalongkorn University, 2006), 21-22.  \n289 Please note that the various names of these selected melodic patterns (thamnong) depend the different local \ndialects and accents.

These patterns help to create \nthe intervallic characteristics of this composition’s melodic movements. It is also noticeable \nthat the melodic contour of “Thamnong ngiew” tends to be in skip-wise motion when \ncompared to the lyrical type of Thai classical music that tends to be in stepwise motion. \nSurprisingly, the note B—which is not considered part of the structure of the A minor \npentatonic scale—also frequently appears, providing a contrast to the sound of penta-centric \nideas common in Thai classical music and traditional northeastern isan nuea music. \n \nAnother striking musical element discovered in the transcription process concerns the \napplication of perpetual eighth-note rhythms, which is evident throughout the transcription. \nThis rhythmic performance method is considered to be one of the key features of performance \non the pi koy and other instruments from the pi jum family. Because pi koy players perform this \ninstrument by holding the top of the instrument in their mouths constantly and relying on \ncircular breathing, they are capable of performing perpetual rhythmic patterns without taking \na breath or needing to stop for breathing. In addition, the use of the melodic embellishments \nwidely demonstrated in this transcription play a crucial role in creating the individual character \nof pi koy performances—especially in the blending of pitches in both downward and upward \nmotions and the application of trill techniques called phrom niu (พรมนิ%ว). Inchan Muncharoen has \napplied these elements in multiple areas of his performance to produce the characteristic sound \nof pi jum. \n \nUnlike southeastern rong ngeng and isan nuea, where homophonic textures are used, the musical \ntexture of khap saw performances appears to be heterophony, with a variety of instrument \nconfigurations performing variations of fundamental melodic lines. Of the numerous pi jum \nensembles, three main types are frequently employed in khap saw of the northwestern region. \nThe first type of accompanying ensemble is known as wong pi jum sam (three instruments) and \nconsists of a pi koy, pi krang, pi lek, sueng, and a male and female vocalist. The second type, which \nis used in a modern setting, is wong pi jum si (four instruments), and includes a pi koy, pi krang, pi \nlek, pi mae or sueng, as well as a male and female vocalist. The third model of ensemble is the \nwong pi jum ha (five instruments), and consists of a pi koy, pi krang, pi lek, pi mae, pi tat, and a male \nand female vocalist. In contrast, in the northeastern area, only one setup is widely observed for \naccompanying khap saw performances—wong salo saw pin, which consists of one salo kop (fret \n",

These melodies must be \nrelated to the instruments’ ranges and typically approach the final pitches of the musical phrases \nas displayed in m. 7, 11, 16, 20, 24, and 28 (red rectangles) in order to create the heterophonic \ntexture of traditional northern music. \n \nThis performance is an example of how the pi jum ensemble—which includes the pi koy, pi \nklang, pi lek, and pi mae––typically functions. The pi koy plays a short introductory solo from \nmm.1-4, and the other instruments simultaneously enter on the second beat of m.4. And, \nsimilar to the plae thamnong technique applied by Thai classical musicians, each musical phrase \nhas a target pitch for all the players, which they must coordinate with the mandatory pitch \nprovided by the pi koy player. This musical interpretation of the principal melodies is called the \nor kae (ออกแก) technique in the northern Thai dialect. \n \nAnother interesting aspect of this transcription is the use of octave unison, which is shown in \nthe rectangle labeled #1. This performance style, which is based on pi koy melodies, can be \napplied to other pi instruments, as seen in mm.12-14 and m.17. Importantly, the instrumental \nranges of wong pi jum play an important role in constructing the musical textures of \nthis performance, ranging from pi koy (main melody), pi lek (soprano), pi klang (tenor), and pi \nmae (bass). I apply these to my writing for saxophone soli. \n \nOne of the prominent rhythmic characteristics of pi jum performances concerns the application \nof musical accents in the second and the fourth beats, which are somewhat similar to the \nmusical accents applied in sueng and isan nuea performance and the rhythm of jazz. This \nrhythmic technique is a consequence of the circular breathing method of pi jum players, in \nparticular, their consecutive breaths executed rhythmically. This technique is also known as hom \nlom (ห่มลม) in the northern dialect. Furthermore, the melodic construction of “Thamnong Japu” \nappears to be in disjunct motion, with large intervals extending over the third interval regularly \nplayed in a set of perpetual eighth-note rhythms, which significantly produced the fundamental \ncharacteristics of a pi jum performance (khap saw). Please note the vocal sound produced by the \ninteraction between a male and female vocalist, and that singing from northern poetry is also \nperformed in coordination with the instruments’ sounds.  \n \n \n \n",

This particular ensemble consists of two types of \ninstruments and, sometimes, vocalists: one salo kop, two pin (lute-type instruments), and one \nmale and one female vocalist—if performing in a singing context. One of the prominent \ncharacteristics produced by this musical ensemble is the salo kop’s bright and gleaming timbre, \nwhich is produced by its steel strings. Another prominent characteristic is the effect of the \nperpetual rhythms of the principal melodies, mainly as eighth notes. This is musically reinforced \nby the sound of two wooden lute instruments (pin), which contribute significantly to the \nsophisticated heterophonic texture of salo pin performances. Nowadays, several traditional \nnorthern compositions which have prefixed titles referring to “Saw” in the Lanna dialect are \nstill frequently performed, such as 1) “Saw Long Nan,” 2) “Saw Laplae (ซอ ลับแล),” 3) “Saw \nPanfai,” 4) “Saw Dan Nan,” and 5) “Saw Phra Lo Doen Dong, (ซอ พระลอเดินดง).”  \n \nTo better understand the structure of the melodic structures of salo pin compositions, I decided \nto transcribe two compositions—“Saw Dan Nan” and “Saw Panfai”—which I will discuss \nbriefly and use in my compositional prototypes.

Lastly, I partly applied the four-part double-lead technique that is \nfrequently employed in saxophone soli writings to the baritone saxophone part. In this baritone \nsaxophone part, the instrument performs one or two octaves below the lead part provided by \nthe soprano saxophone. As a consequence, this saxophone soli is capable of producing a \nversion of the characteristic sound of northern Thai music by using jazz orchestra instruments \nand their corresponding conventional techniques (Figure 6.6).  \n \n \nFigure 6.6: Saxophone soli inspired by pi jum. \n \nIn a second musical hybridization compositional example, I composed a contemporary jazz \ncomposition entitled “Phumin” by integrating the five melodic patterns of two traditional \ncompositions, namely “Saw Dan Nan” and “Saw Pan Fai” (Figure 6.7).

The \nmajor distinction between these locations can be found in the use of different instruments, \nsuch as salo and salo kop, or in the names of musical groups, such as salo, saw, and sueng ensembles \n(northwest) and salo, saw, pin ensembles (northeast). Pi jum is a crucial instrument in this region’s \nnorthwest musical tradition, and it may be paired with other instruments from the pi family and \nperformed as wong pi jum for khap saw performances. Pi jum’s melodic lines are based on disjunct \nmotions that combine several interval patterns, such as ascending and descending minor third \nintervals, which emphasize intervallic qualities rather stepwise motion, shown in Thai classical \nmusic’s lyrical composition type. Other technical methods, like bending and trills, are also used \nto offer this instrument a particular character. Importantly, pi jum is also constantly performed \nin eighth-note rhythm, which is the result of hom lom techniques. Furthermore, as demonstrated \nin the preliminary compositional process, the melodic lines of pi jum ensemble, which create \nfrom three to five instruments, are capable of adapting to the woodwind section of a jazz \norchestra.  \n \nUnlike the northwest, the northeast’s khap saw performance used a wong salo (saw) pin ensemble \nto accompany vocalists rather than a wong pi jum. The previous transcriptions of the wong salo, \n",

When compared to other \nThai instruments, the bright sound of salo kop and its fretboard can make it easier to transcribe. \nAs opposed to isan nuea melodies, which rely on the penta-centric concept, the melodic \nstructure of northern Thai music can be formed from natural minor or Dorian scales, with the \nsound of 2nd and 6th degrees, heard in its melodic movement as demonstrated in “Thamnong \nngiew” and “Saw Dan Nan.” This can help jazz composers, and others interested in working \nwith Thai music traditions to realize that not all music traditions of Thailand are grounded on \nthe penta-centric concept. Performances of rong ngeng and lanna music are among the \nexceptions. Interestingly, the use of sliding and trills, which are widely used in northern music \nperformances can also be imitated by western instruments in jazz orchestra, such as flute and \nclarinet to emphasize the musical features of northern music performances. \n \nIn Chapters 3 to 6, I examined key musical aspects of Thai musical traditions in order to \ndevelop a better appreciation of how Thai music functions, as well as composing a preliminary \nor prototype piece drawing on transcriptions of Thai music and experimentally incorporating \njazz musical elements as a case study for myself and other jazz composers who might be \ninterested in this music. As stated in the research methodology section, understanding of the \nkey musical features of these traditions emerges from the concept of learning music by ear \nthrough the transcribing process and a review of relevant works in Thai music studies. As a \nresult, these four chapters have provided critical insights into Thai musical traditions, a crucial \nstep before I began producing the key creative outcomes for this research.

It is divided \ninto four sections. The first section discusses four compositions inspired by Thai classical \nmusic. “Buang-Suang” (“Deity Worship”) is a piece of ritual and worship music that pays \nrespect to the music gods, the great teachers, and the three gems of Buddhism; “Phuen Ban” \n(“Village Song”) is a conventional big-band composition inspired by the character of traditional \nThai penta-centric melodies; “Samniang Jin” (“Porcelain”) is a contemporary jazz piece that \nadopts a transcultural Thai-Chinese musical idiom; and “Patchim” (“Epilogue”) is a farewell \ncomposition inspired by the traditional practices of Thai classical music.

These three compositions, \nwhich are influenced by regional traditional Thai music, are: “Mekong” (“River of Souls”), an \ninterpretation of music of northeastern Thailand (isan nuea); “Singora” (“Dance of Kinnari”), a \ncontemporary jazz orchestral piece that illustrates the multicultural practices of southern \nThailand, where the music cultures of Thai Buddhists (nora) and Muslims (rong ngeng) have \ninteracted with each other; and “Wiang Haeng” (“The Northern Rhapsody”), a contemporary \njazz composition inspired by the performance practices of traditional northern Thai music \n(khap saw and sueng). Unlike the previous four compositions that were inspired by Thai classical \nmusic, I undertake a comprehensive musical analysis of these three compositions not only to \ndemonstrate the level of musical integration of regional Thai musical elements, but also to \nhighlight the level of complexity of the jazz compositional techniques that I utilized to create \nthese pieces.  \n \nThe musical elements of the Thai music traditions employed to create jazz orchestral works \nand applied in my commentary on these compositions are divided into two separate categories. \nThe first group consists of musical elements that I learned throughout my research on Thai \nmusical traditions, as well as the transcribing process discussed in previous chapters, and of \nnew elements based on what I discovered during the compositional processes of the jazz \norchestra project and further transcriptions of mine, which are discussed in this chapter. I then \nemployed these musical elements to create sketch scores of my initial ideas before expanding \nthem into full jazz orchestra compositions. The second category includes musical elements I \nencountered in my archival research on four books containing Thai musical manuscripts that \nI discovered when visiting Thailand in 2019. These books are: Collected Works of the Thai Classical \nRepertoire Vol. 4, and 6 by Panya Roongruang297—which were originally published by The Thai \nMusic Manuscript Committee from 1930 to 1932, and 1936 to 1942 respectively; and Thai Music \nManuscript Vol. 1, and Vol. 3,298 which were first published by the Thai Fine Arts Department. \nI spent a significant amount of time learning to play transcriptions obtained from the four \n                                                        \n297 Panya Roongruang, Collected Works of the Thai Classical Repertoire Vol.4-6, (Bangkok: Kasetsart University, \n2001). \n298 Montri Tramote et al., Thai Music Manuscript Vol. 1 (Bangkok: The Fine Arts Department, 1996).

The benefit \nof employing these structures of musical analysis is that they assist jazz composers in \nrevealing—and discussing––the orchestration, harmonization, vocal techniques, form, solo \nbackground parts, balance, and other important compositional techniques used in jazz \norchestra compositions. To adhere to these frameworks, my commentary in this chapter will \nbegin with general observations on the various compositional approaches—including artistic \ninspirations, melody, harmony, and rhythm—before providing a comprehensive analysis of \nspecific writing techniques, and then addressing in detail the elements of Thai music that I have \nincluded, transformed, and infused into the pieces. (Appendix D contains the seven scores for \nmy portfolio of jazz orchestra compositions.) \n \n7.1 COMPOSITIONS INSPIRED BY THAI CLASSICAL MUSIC  \n \n“BUANG-SUANG” (“DEITY WORSHIP”) \n \n“Buang-Suang” (“Deity Worship”) is a jazz orchestra composition inspired by “Psalm,” the \nfinal movement of John Coltrane’s album, A Love Supreme (1965), which Coltrane described as \nhis spiritual proclamation of faith in God.299 Similarly, in the wai khru tradition, Thai classical \nmusicians also perform a specific music repertoire (phleng naphat) to invite all deities and to pay \nhomage to their teachers during the ceremony. Inspired by both A Love Supreme and the wai \nkhru tradition, my intention in composing this piece was for it to serve as a musical devotion \nthat intertwined my faith in the gods of music as well as an overture for this project. Through \nthe sound of a jazz orchestra, I also intended for it to pay homage to all Thai musical masters. \n                                                        \n299 Coltrane’s improvisation on “Psalm” reveals that his sax solo is a wordless “recitation” of the poem he included \nin the liner notes to A Love Supreme, with one note for each syllable. Each section of several lines has an arch \nshape—an ascending phrase, a recitation on one tone, and a descending phrase. The recitation tones ascend as \nthe piece builds in intensity. Coltrane’s poem is punctuated with the frequently recurring words “Thank You, \nGod.” At the final word of the poem, “Amen,” he clearly plays “Amen” on his sax. Coltrane adds a flourish only \non that final word. See, Lewis Porter, John Coltrane His Life and Music (University Michigan Press, 1999), 244-249. \n \n",

I \nconstructed these melodies from various motifs in quarter-note triplets performed by two alto \nsaxophones, soprano saxophone, and flugelhorn. I then created the improvisational section for \nthe trumpet and drums (using mallets in a manner reminiscent of Elvin Jones’s drumming), in \norder to contribute further emotional improvisations that interact with the melodies in a similar \nway to the “Psalm” recording. To express the sound of Thai ceremonial music, I adopted the \nthang khong wong yai of the “Sathukan”300 (See Roongruang, Collected Works of the Thai Classical \nRepertoire Vol. 6, p. 126 in mm. 1-10), which is considered the most fundamental piece in Thai \nmusic, according to Panya Roongruang’s musical manuscripts. I later adjusted these melodic \nlines obtained from the manuscripts to unify the motifs in the melodies I composed, and also \nmodified certain notes in order to align them with the harmonies I composed (see Figure 7.1). \n                                                        \n300 The “Sathukan” is the first composition that Thai musicians must learn before attending a wai khru ceremony. \nThe composer of this composition is anonymous, yet the distinct variations can be observed in different Thai \nmusic teachers.

This work was inspired by one of my students in \nThailand, who shared his discontent on social media during the recent political turmoil in the \ncountry, writing: “What I had been taught in a jazz history class is that this music has been \nstrongly associated with freedom of expression, democracy, and civil rights movements, but \nwhy do Thai jazz musicians only use this music for one purpose, which is to serve rich people?” \nAs a result, I would like to devote this jazz orchestra piece to my fellow colleagues in the lower-\nmiddle class and hope that this composition will be used as a musical tool to promote a sense \nof social equality in Thailand. I also believe that jazz in Thailand will someday become more \nassociated with the social-cultural practices of all Thai people, rather than as a genre for one \nspecific part of society. \n \nThe fundamental melodic lines of “Phuen Ban” are the product of thematic development that \nstarts with a simple melodic pattern. As the piece progresses, this thematic melody becomes \nmore developed, before reaching its climax in several sections of this composition. I have also \nadapted elements of three other Thai classical works—“Khmen Liep Nakhon (เขมรเลียบนคร),” \n“Khmen Phuang (เขมรพวง),” and “Saen Kham Nung,”302 all composed by Luang Pradit Pairoh \n(Son Silpabanleng)––to my melodic lines in multiple places. \n \nThe harmonic rhythm of “Phuen Ban” has been designed to suit the characteristic sound of a \ntraditional jazz orchestra, which features functional harmony. The key centers are A major and \nE♭ major, which have been used to construct standard chord progressions (e.g., ii7 V7 Imaj7 or I \nIV7 ii7 V7). The two main solos in the improvisation section are on piano and soprano \nsaxophone. Trumpet with plunger mute, trombone, and clarinet ad-lib solos, all referencing \nEllington’s jazz orchestral style, can also be heard several times throughout this work. \n \nUnlike other compositions in this project, the rhythm of “Phuen Ban” is centered on heavy-\nswing and ragtime grooves.

The \nmusical elements of nora and rong ngeng serve as the principal ingredients of this composition. \nStrategies for adapting these musical elements include: the use of the “Sot Soi” melodic pattern, \nthe application of the kheun hua pi technique of pi nora, the rhythmic adaption of rong ngeng \ntanyong performances, and the thematic melody of “Tari Kipas” as performed by Khadae \nWaedeng, which I also transcribed from the southeastern rong ngeng repertoire for this \ncomposition. Furthermore, I have included two monologues that narrate the romantic story of \nPra Suthon and Manora—which is one of the famous Thai works of literature used in nora \nperformances.  \n \nThe thematic melody of the composition is divided into two sections, namely a musical \nadaptation of two melodies from the “Sot Sot” (nora) and “Tari Kipas” (Southeastern rong \nngeng), and the original melodies I composed to respond to them. “Singora” is based on E♭ \nMixolydian, F Lydian dominant, and G Ionian modes. The modulation techniques without \npivot chords in various sections of the composition create a feeling of surprise and \nunpredictability.  \n \nTo express the rhythmic ideas of southern Thai music, I adapted traditional Afro-Cuban \nrhythmic patterns, which, in my view, function effectively alongside southern Thai melodic \nrhythms. I use swing, hip-hop drum beats, and patterns of contemporary jazz fusion to create \nfundamental rhythmic patterns in the rhythm section. In addition, intricate polyrhythmic ideas \nappear in the brass and the rhythm sections in multiple places.

The spoken text of this section is narrated by the female vocalist in mm.25-59 by using \ndistortion effects to produce a more modern sound suited to the composition. My English \ntranslation of the story is quoted below: \n \n",
    "241": " \nCHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand \n \n \n225 \nPra Suthon and Manora is a story of forbidden love between a human and a female mythical figure, who is half-\nbird and half-human and lives beyond the Himavanta forest. One day, while taking a bath in an ancient lake in \nthe mysterious forest of the human realm, Manora is captured by Phran Boon, a ferocious hunter, who later \nhands her over to Pra Suthon, the heir to the Kingdom of Uttarapancala. As soon as they see each other, they \nfall in love because of the loving spirit that they had in their past lives. However, a jealous brahmin falsely tells \nthe king, Artit Wong, Pra Suthon’s father, that Manora would bring about a deterioration of his reign and \nrequests the sacrifice of Manora. So reluctantly, Manora leaves Pra Suthon behind without saying goodbye and \nsecretly flees to Mouth Kailash, where humans are unable to go.319 \n \nFor the first thematic melody of “Singora,” I transcribed the prominent melodic pattern of the \ncomposition “Tari Kipas”320 performed by Khadae Waedeng (Figure 7.42). Then, I retained \nthe target notes of B♭ and of the group of descending notes to the pitch C (in the red circles), \nwhich I later include in the melody I composed for the soprano saxophone (Figure 7.43). \n \nFigure 7.42 The original melody of “Tari Kipas.” Transcription by the author. \n \nFigure 7.43: The adaption of the “Tari Kipas” melody in “Singora” (mm.59-64). \n \n                                                        \n319 The story of Pra Suthon and Manora is a popular Thai performance that can be seen throughout Thailand, in \nparticular the center. The plot of this literature has been also reproduced and appears in Thai TV programs \nseveral times. For the introduction of the story of Pra Suthon and Manora, see Henry D. Ginsburg, “The \nManora Dance-Drama: An introduction< https://thesiamsociety.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/1972/03/JSS_060_2h_Ginsburg_ManoraDanceDrama.pdf>  \nuploaded by The Siam Society (n.d.). \n320 The original melody of “Tari Kipas” was transcribed from Khadae Waedeng’s performance, which was \nreleased by theOngkhaphayop at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ88gk-GNKY> (January 23, 2011). \nPlease note that the key signature in Figure 7.43 has been transposed from the original key signature in G major \nscale. \n",
    "242": " \nCHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand \n \n \n226 \nBesides adapting the remaining “Tari Kipas” melody to construct the melodic lines of \n“Singora,” I composed an original melody that functions as an answer passage to the “Tari \nKipas” melody. These melodic lines consist of the combination of an E♭ minor pentatonic \nscale—based on the character of the Thai melody—and a C Phrygian dominant scale (m.74). \nThis produces a sound akin to another significant influence of rong ngeng music––Arabic \nmusic—and appears in the third trumpet part (Figure 7.44). \n \n \nFigure 7.44:  The melody from “Singora” in the third trumpet part (mm.69-76). \n \nTo combine the sound of nora music with rong ngeng performances, I applied the short melodic \nline of the “Sot Soi” pattern (transcribed in Chapter 5), and then made adaptions to the vocal, \nlead alto (soprano saxophone) and trumpet parts, allowing this melody to function as the \nthematic melody of the D section (Figure 7.45). I also avoided an overly repetitive sound of \nthis memorable pattern through key changes and rhythmic adjustments. For example, I shifted \nthe melody from the E♭ major scale to the C Locrian by adding the pitch D♭ (m.118), which \nis performed by the vocalist. This technique also provides the sound of the flat 2, which is \nanother integration of the characteristic sound rong ngeng music to nora performance (Figure \n7.46). \n \n \n",

The \nprogressions of B/A, E♭6/9, and C6/9 also provide unconventional chord movements which can \ndecrease the sense of predictability that is often present in other transitional sections in jazz \norchestra writings.

The route to my world is certainly not for humans, but for non-humans only,” \nsays Manora.

This composition also attempts \nto aesthetically depict the mountain ranges and valleys of the northern parts of Thailand. To \ncreate such sounds and provide such depictions, I adapt northern Thai khap saw and sueng \nperformance techniques for instruments of the jazz orchestra such as those of the woodwind \nsection and the guitar. In addition, I reharmonized two prominent northern traditional \ncompositions called “Long Mae Ping,” “Selemao,” and “Fon Ngiew (ฟ้อนเงี%ยว),”321 all of which \nwere transcribed specifically for this composition and can be heard in multiple sections. \n \nThe fundamental melodies of this composition include an original thematic melody I \ncomposed, and musical adaptions of two northern traditional melodies, “Selemao” and “Long \nMae Ping.” The original melody first appears in the flute parts, and constitutes six measures of \nmelodic patterns based on the F major pentatonic scale. This melody depicts the sound of calm \nand gentleness of northern Thai music. It is later developed and expanded to four different \nvariations.  \n \nThe harmonic design of “The Northern Rhapsody” is based primarily on non-functional \nchord-to-chord successions. My intention with this compositional approach was to reflect the \nsound of northern traditional melodies through complicated jazz harmonies as much as \npossible. In addition, the use of extended chords such as maj13, sus13, and mi11, as well as \npolychords, are meant to emphasize sounds of tension while creating harmonies for the \nprominent Thai melodies throughout the composition. \n \nThe rhythmic style of the composition mimics the performance of jazz ballads and slow \nbackbeat drum patterns, where time signatures such as 5/4, 7/4, and 11/8 are employed to \n                                                        \n321 “Fon Ngiew” is a Thai classical composition that is performed in the center of Thailand to accompany \ntraditional Thai northern dance.

The construction of pi jum melodic lines is also \nbased on intervallic features in disjunct motion which typically extend over ascending and \ndescending second intervals as also revealed in the transcription in Chapter 6.

As explained in Chapter 6, the rhythmic movements \nof khap saw performances are performed as perpetual rhythms without stopping, a pi jum \nperformance method called hom lom (involving circular breathing). To imitate this technique, I \nconstructed the multiple motive lines which are intertwined with each other and performed in \nthe woodwind sections (mm.11 – mm.16) by using the eighth sixteenth, and eighth note triplet \nwithout any interruptions of the continuous sound of the section (Figure 7.60). \n \n",

Rather than \napplying such musical components directly and noticeably to my composition as I had done in \nearlier projects, I blended them with my own interpretation to create complex layers where \nThai musical influences are intertwined with my original compositional material. This produces \nhybridity that integrates the musical elements of jazz and Thai music, highlighting principles of \nmusical innovation. Examples of my compositional processes include:  \n \n1) transforming Thai melodies to intermingle with contemporary jazz musical \nelements;  \n2) incorporating Thai melodies and combining them with my own melodies to create \nthematic melodies;  \n3) employing melodic lines from Thai musical traditions in one layer to interact with \nmy original melodic lines in a second layer, which simulate Thai musical textures;  \n4) adapting Thai idiomatic instruments to jazz orchestra instruments;  \n5) modifying Thai rhythmic patterns to be used in the rhythm section such as in the \nbass and percussion parts;  \n6) applying Thai compositional techniques to jazz orchestra composition; and \n7) converting Thai literature into monologues to be read, to interact with jazz styles. \n \nIn addition, I also used synthesizer, pedal effects, electric bass, and drum machines to express \ntraditional Thai musical elements through contemporary timbres, which had a significant \nimpact on my compositional perspective and process. \n \nIn evaluating the compositional experiences of working in four different regions of Thai music \ntraditions, I found that isan nuea musical elements appear to be more flexible when applying its \ntraditional melodies. These elements operate well with contemporary jazz harmonies, as can \nisan nuea instrument techniques, which can be effectively adapted by western instruments, such \nas alto saxophone or electric guitar. Rong ngeng rhythmic patterns performed by bass, as well as \nthe khuen hua pi technique of nora as applied to soprano saxophone, appear to incorporate well \n",

The adaptation of polyphonic \nstratification derived from Thai classical music textures resulted in an interesting resource for \njazz composing methods. This approach introduced multiple independent lines into the jazz \norchestra music texture, resulting sounds quite distinct from the styles of section writing used \nin conventional jazz orchestra compositions. The use of khap saw performance from northern \nThai music performances can be used in the woodwind section, particularly for the flute and \nclarinet, to establish a texture almost like a fugue. In addition to the musical elements \nmentioned above, I found that the use of Thai literature, such as the interpretation of Thai \npoetry in “Patchim” (“Epilogue”), and the use of Pra Suthon and Manora’s monologues in \n“Singora” (“Dance of Kinnari”), contribute yet another interesting method of presenting the \nThai aspects into jazz orchestra performances.  \n \nWhen it came to obstacles I had to overcome while working on this project, I sometimes found \nit difficult to produce references to Thai idiomatic instruments such as the ti kep, which is \nplayed by ranad ek, in woodwinds, brass, or vocals. To avoid such issues, I had to locate \nappropriate instruments to play such specialized approaches, for example, a vibraphone, guitar, \nor synthesizer, or I had to break such techniques down into small motifs so that a woodwind \ninstrument could execute them. Second, to avoid the pentatonic scale’s repetitive sound, which \nis the core structure of many Thai music traditions, I used key modulation or slightly adjusted \ninterval patterns or applied metric modulations, which may provide a productive distraction \nfrom the penta-centric concept. As a result, I discovered that such compositional strategies \nwork effectively, particularly in the piece “Mekong,” which I believe is an exemplary case of \navoiding the recurrence of pentatonic scales while also increasing the complexity of Thai \nmelodies through a variety of jazz composition approaches. \n \nThe most essential point, however, is how the balance between Thai musical traditions and \njazz is achieved. While working on sketch scores, I carefully considered the degree to which \nThai and jazz musical elements should each be included in the original compositions, and my \nfinal goal was to convey those musical elements equally. This process can be seen in multiple \nparts of the original compositions, with one example being the presence of Thai musical \ninfluences in the background as interplay with soloists in improvisation sections, where my \nobjective is to keep the Thai musical elements intact even when a soloist is improvising. \nHowever, as mentioned previously in the introduction to this chapter, I situate these works as \nexamples of musical hybridization, which is defined as the blending of more than two distinct \n",

    "279": " \nCHAPTER 8: Conclusion \n \n \n263 \nhope that this study, now complete, will be beneficial to many composers and scholars, \nincluding composers from any background who are interested in Thai music traditions. \n \nMy research questions led me to musical experiences of attempting to combine aspects of jazz \nand Thai music. Although these two genres are entirely distinct due to their geographical \norigins, several Thai musical structures are comprehensible to practitioners of jazz (related to \nmy first research question). Some examples include:  \n \n1) the comparison of Thai classical music to jazz musical forms;  \n2) the idiomatic improvisation of Thai classical musician based on luk tok similar to jazz \nperformers who learn to improvise by using target pitches;  \n3) the correlation between Thai classical compositional techniques and the \ncompositional method of jazz (e.g., luk yon [pedal point] or thang plien [melodic \nvariation]);  \n4) the concept of thang khreuang dontri, which refers to a style of instrumental music used \nin Thai classical performance to create Thai music texture––employed in jazz \norchestra writing it can produce independent melodic lines;  \n5) the performance of thang dio, which uses instrumental techniques similar to Western \nmusic; \n6) the performance methods of khaen, and pi jum, which are primarily based on the \nconstruction of intervallic patterns similar to an approach to jazz improvisation;  \n7) the accompaniment of khaen and phin which produce equivalents to suspended chords \nin jazz harmony;  \n8) the use of Dorian mode in salo-pin compositions; and \n9) the similarities between the rhythmic accents of isan nuea music, sueng, and khap saw \nperformances and the swing feel, all of which emphasize the upbeat. \n \nThese musical experiences have revealed to me that even when working with music from two \nor more distinct musical traditions, there are always some common aspects that may be \neffectively modified.  \n \nAs I indicated previously that my philosophical idea is based on a pragmatic approach, I believe \nthat transcribing Thai music elements into Western notation has also provided me with a \npractical approach to modifying Thai music elements for use in jazz compositions (related to \n",
    "280": " \nCHAPTER 8: Conclusion \n \n \n264 \nmy second research question). This method provided me with insight into how musicians of \nThai traditions perform their music. While transcribing, I was able to absorb the character of \nthe various types of Thai music, allowing me to establish the concept of “the Thai sound” in \nmy consciousness, which was similar to my initial step in learning to improvise on jazz. The \nsuccessful output produced by the transcription process is explicitly illustrated in my analysis \nin chapters on Thai traditions, my prototype compositions, and my jazz orchestra work. \nExamples include:  \n \n1) the use of a jazz analysis approach to stimulate melodies modeled (equivalent to jazz \nlicks) from Thai classical music and northern Thai salo (saw) pin transcriptions;  \n2) the imitation of khaen, phin, and sueng played by alto saxophone and guitar, which I \nadapted from transcriptions of isan nuea music;  \n3) the compositional methods that I employed in the soprano saxophone derived from \nthe transcription of khuen hua pi techniques in Chapter 5; \n4) the transcriptions of Thai classical music rhythms (nathap) and rong ngeng rhythmic \npatterns, which were used in the bass parts in the original works; and  \n5) numerous Thai melodies that were obtained through the transcription processes and \nafterward used in original pieces. \n \nThe transcribing processes, in contrast from learning from literature alone, granted me with \nindividual compositional aspects, which I then applied to my compositional processes \nthroughout this research.  \n  \nIn the artistic experience of working to balance the musical elements of Thai music and jazz in \nmy compositional process (my third research question), I also encountered a significant \nchallenge in maintaining both two musical aspects equally. My intent was, and is, to create \nmusical works that could be attractive to both jazz and Thai audiences. Several questions come \nto mind while I worked on this project, such as: Why does this section sound “too” jazz, or \nwhy does this section appear to be “too” Thai? And are these works interesting from the \nviewpoint of jazz composition? Will Thai composers and traditional musicians be interested in \nthese works? In one straightforward example, I encountered a challenge when working on the \nrhythm of Thai melodies. It appeared to me that I could not use too many syncopated beats \nsince it would diminish the impression of Thai melodic character, but if I did not supply any \nsyncopated rhythms, the melodies would lack one of the significant features of jazz. As a result, \n",
    "281": " \nCHAPTER 8: Conclusion \n \n \n265 \nI have had to pay close attention to the amounts of Thai and jazz musical elements that I put \ninto this project in order to produce musical hybridizations, which are still innovative and \ndistinct from those created by other composers who have previously worked on cross-cultural \nThai music projects, some of which are mentioned in Chapter 2. \n \nThe timbres of Thai instruments, which can play an important part in providing Thai musical \ncharacteristics, are something I found lacking in this project, in a somewhat unsatisfying way. \nEven though I attempted to employed western instruments from similar instrument families \nto reference or imitate the timbre of Thai instruments, such as a soprano saxophone for the pi \nnora (reed instrument) or a vibraphone for the ranad ek (xylophone), I found it was difficult for \nwestern instruments to accommodate the unique timbre of Thai instruments that constitute \nthe actual sonic experience of Thai musical traditions, and could, theoretically, be used to \nbalance the musical timbre between jazz and Thai features. In the future, I plan to compose \nfor Thai instruments as an important part of my jazz orchestra music.  \n \nThe difference in tuning systems between Thai instruments and Western instruments presented \nme with my greatest challenge to the concept of “learning by ear” while working on this \nresearch (related to my fourth research question). The tuning systems of Thai and Western \ninstruments are categorically different, and it is common to find traditional Thai instruments \nto be “out of tune” in terms of Western music perception. Consequently, I would advise jazz \ncomposers to take proper care when choosing recordings for transcribing. Although Thai \ntraditional instruments may employ different tuning systems, several have been adapted to \nWestern tuning (sieng sakon) and played in fusion bands, as mentioned by my interviewee \nSomuek Saengarun and discussed in John Garzoli’s dissertation. These instruments, such as pi \nnai, ranad ek, khlui, khaen, phin, pi nora, and sueng are frequently available in Western tunings that \nmay be ideal for jazz composers to use for transcription, and for hybridization projects.  \n \nAnother obstacle I encountered during this research was the difference between Thai and \nWestern music in their notions of rhythm. Thai musicians, unlike Western musicians, do not \nperform at a steady tempo, which is indicated in music scores. As a result, the tempo of Thai \nmusic might be slow or fast depending on the performer’s perception, in particular regional \ntraditional Thai music, such as isan nuea or lanna music, which do not include a ching player in \nensembles. Regarding the time signature I used in my transcription processes, I still believe that \nthe use of 2/4 meter, first introduced by the Thai Fine Arts Department committee in 1929, \n",
    "282": " \nCHAPTER 8: Conclusion \n \n \n266 \ncan help us to understand Thai rhythmic phrases more easily, as well as being more useful for \nsight reading. I also observed that using Thai nathap on drums does not seem to work well in a \njazz orchestra setting, so I had to employ them in the bass parts instead. And, if I try to \nsyncopate such beat patterns, the Thai rhythmic character will be lost. As a consequence, I will \nrequire further study, and more time, to concentrate solely on the rhythms of Thai classical \nmusic, which I will attempt in a future project. Interestingly, when transcribing regional music \nfrom the Northeast (khaen and phin performances) and the North (khap saw performances), I \nobserved that these two rhythmic patterns are characterized by rhythmic accents on the upbeat, \na feature shared with the swing feel. Having a rhythmic similarity can be beneficial when \nattempting to integrate Thai melodies from these two regions with jazz musical components. \n \n8.2 DEFINING AN ARTISTIC POSITION \n \nOne of the most important developments I have made as a result of this research is in my \nartistic identity and position as composer engaged in musical hybridization. My artistic aim is \nto offer Thai musical qualities and express the essence of Thai music through a contemporary \nperspective, as indicated by the music I composed for this project. Unlike my previous projects, \nwhere I was concerned about my Thainess, and in which I intended my works to sound “Thai” \nto Thai musicians, this research project has allowed me to break free from such limiting \nattitudes and cultural boundaries. I also learned that the most appealing aspect of being a \ncomposer of musical hybridization is being honest with yourself and using your originality to \ninterpret musical traditions. As a result, these seven jazz orchestra compositions reflect my \nfeelings on Thai qualities that are not overtly influenced by traditional or progressive \nviewpoints on Thai music. These compositions demonstrate how I personally perceive Thai \ncharacteristics that I chose to express in my jazz-oriented compositional process. \n \nI have found that the jazz and Thai music traditions, among others, have traditionalists and \nprogressivists continually debating notions of authenticity and purity. However, after spending \na significant amount of time studying these two musical cultures, I discovered that what appeals \nto me about them is their shared practice of multiculturalism, their shared openness to foreign \ncultures that allowed these two styles to blend effectively with other musical influences and, in \nmy project, with one another. These two musical cultures seem to join ethnomusicologists in \n",
    "283": " \nCHAPTER 8: Conclusion \n \n \n267 \nremaining skeptical about “purity,” agreeing that “no traditional music is ever static, since \nchanges must appear during the transmission.”326 \n \nThough I still believe that the term “tradition” can provide “authentic” experiences to \naudiences and these two words also should be granted to both jazz and Thai musicians who \nhave committed their lives to these two kinds of music in the past, I would like to convince \nother traditionalists that without openness and a progressive outlook, these two styles of music \nwould become rigid and lack diversity, in contradiction to their origins. Wayne Shorter, a \nlegendary jazz musician who has experienced the growth of jazz over the years, supports this \nidea: \nJazz should not have any mandates. Jazz is not supposed to be something that you are required to sound \nlike jazz. For me, the word jazz means, I dare you. And the effort to break out of something is worth \nmore than you getting an A in syncopation.327 \n \nAsdavuth Sagarik, a prominent Thai classical musician, offers another perspective:  \n \nThe question is, why do we need to preserve Thai music? It really doesn’t need to be preserved. \nEverything has its own time. When the term “preservation” is mentioned, it is separated into two \ncategories: conservative and progressive. In reality, everyone possesses both conservative and \nprogressive qualities.328 \n \nCultures have always changed and evolved. It is natural for one culture to interact with another \nto create something new. The original works composed for this research have illustrated what \nstrategies can be used to produce creative works that incorporate the musical knowledge of \ntwo musical traditions with different origins. My musicianship and jazz expertise collided with \nmy Thai identity to generate musical works that I refer to as “hybrid products.” These musical \nhybridizations came about through the infusion, integration, and exchange of jazz \ncompositional techniques and Thai music elements demonstrated in the creative component \nof this project.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                        \n326 Bo-Wah Leung, Traditional Musics in the Modern World: Transmission, Evolution, and Challenges (Springer \nInternational Publishing, 2018), 3-4.  \n327 Wayne Shorter, “On Jazz: How Do You Rehearse the Unknown,” NPR music. \n< https://www.npr.org/transcripts/170882668> 2 February 2013.  \n328 Narkkong, Thai Contemporary Music Bands and Works in Present Thai society,115. \n",
    "284": " \nCHAPTER 8: Conclusion \n \n \n268 \n8.3 FUTURE WORK AND CONCLUSION \n \nOne objective of my research was to add a Thai branch to Duke Ellington’s jazz tree. In fact, \nthough the globalization of jazz is explicitly described in the works of Stuart Nicholson and E. \nTaylor Atkins, to name but two, the jazz world seems to pay little attention to Thai musical \ntraditions, just as it marginalizes many other musical traditions around the world. I am hopeful \nthat the creative output of my project will be used as musical evidence of the merging of jazz \nand the traditional music of Thailand. I also hope that my research methodology can be applied \nto study other musical traditions to enhance the level of diversity in jazz cultures. \n \nMy future work will continue to explore other musical traditions, cultural diversity, and music \nin a global context. I believe we can learn from our differences and establish new intellectual \ncultures by combining our different perspectives, as underlined in Kwame Anthony Appiah’s \ndiscussion of cosmopolitanism. I will start composing for Thai traditional instruments, an \nexperience that I have lacked in this project, and then employ them to perform with my jazz \norchestra, a group I aim to form as a professional ensemble in Thailand. Traditional \ninstruments from outside Thailand which I am looking forward to working on my jazz \norchestra project, including koto, saung, erhu, and serunai, which I will spend more time learning \nusing the research approaches with which I have become familiar in this study. \n \nBeyond conventional jazz composition approaches, there are a vast number of approaches \navailable to jazz composers that can motivate and inspire. Some composers may turn to 21st-\ncentury classical composition techniques, such as acoustic and electronic compositional \ntechniques, while others may seek to revisit and revise the musical achievements and brilliance \nof prominent jazz composers of the past. I decided to turn to the sound of traditional music, \nwhich I believe is a form of musical knowledge that has been cultivated through many \ngenerations. Among the many things that I gained from learning traditional music, the most \nfascinating element of being a jazz composer who studies traditional music is that I am able to \ncombine musical knowledge from the past with my own compositional ideas rooted in jazz. At \nthe same time, I can participate in preserving traditional voices, which are likely to become lost \nas time passes, and present them through the musical features of a contemporary jazz orchestra, \nand incorporating other musical elements, including alternative rock, hip-hop, R&B, and \nelectronica. \n \n",
    "285": " \nCHAPTER 8: Conclusion \n \n \n269 \nThis research demonstrates several practical approaches to how jazz composers can draw on \nThai music traditions to generate innovative methods for composing music, particularly for a \njazz orchestra. Beyond musical genres, authenticities, and national identities, I reckon there is \nmuch we can learn from one another to create and develop new creative perceptions that are \ninspired by other humans.\n",

    "319": " \nAPPENDIX B: Interviews \n \n \n303 \nAPPENDIX B: INTERVIEWS   \nThis appendix contains interview questions and answers between Somnuek Saengarun and \nPerico Sambeat, which were conducted via Zoom July 27-28, 2020. These questions were \ndesigned to show the compositional process and artistic experiences in the context of cross-\ncultural jazz compositions. These two interviews were approved by the Human Ethics \nCommittee at Victoria University of Wellington. The Ethic Approval no. 27969. \n \nInterviewee: Somnuek Saengarun \n \nTime: 35 minutes \n \n \nTanarat Chaichana: Could you please describe how you go about learning to play traditional \nThai instruments? Also, what were your teacher’s approaches for transmitting musical \nknowledge to you? \n \nSomnuek Saengarun: I was born into a musical family. As a result, learning music was a \nregular activity of my childhood. My grandfather taught me how to play khong wong yai. As I \ngrew older, I began to learn different instruments. Every evening after dinner, I had to go to \nmy grandfather’s house to study music. My father used to wake me up at 5 a.m. to practice \nmusic. This has been my daily ritual since I was a child. \n \nTC: Ok. As a result, what tactics did your grandfather employ to instruct you? Is it something \nyou have to recite or sing in Thai notes? \n \nSS: So, my grandfather taught me by playing music on instruments, and I had to follow what \nhe did exactly. At the time, there were no Thai musical notations. Thai musical notation was \nonly used by Thai musicians who were studying in government-funded music institutes. In \naddition, my grandfather also sang melodic lines by mimicking the sounds of instruments, \nwhich I had to convert to instruments and play. \n \nTC: Yes, that’s why I was really impressed by Thai classical musicians. Because the sounds of \nThai classical compositions are incredibly complicated, you have to learn everything from \nphrase to phrase. This process indeed requires a lot of time. So, my next question is still about \n",
    "320": " \nAPPENDIX B: Interviews \n \n \n304 \nthe general concept of Thai classical music. Can you explain why the majority of Thai classical \nmusicians can play practically every instrument in a Thai ensemble? Was this also necessary for \nyour learning process? \n \nSS: The most significant aspect, in my opinion, is that every Thai musician must first learn to \nplay khong wong yai in order to master the fundamental melody known as thamnong lak. This \nthematic melody can then be applied to different instruments according to their idioms, which \nyou can think of as plae thamnong approaches. As a result, once Thai musicians have mastered \nthe fundamental melody, which is the first level of study, they want to increase their musical \nexpertise by learning other instruments.  \n \nTC: Could you kindly explain how to conduct plae thamnong approaches (a musical technique \nin which a player asks that a fundamental melody be interpreted and played on their \ninstruments)? To what extent can Thai musicians improvise when performing such techniques? \n \nSS: To begin, you must understand that Thai classical music is separated into two categories: \nphleng bangkhap thang (a composition which does not enable a musician to improvise) and phleng \nmai bangkhap thang (a composition that allows a player to improvise). “Lao Duang Duen,” \n“Khmer Sai Yok,” and “Saen Kham Nung,” for example, are musical pieces in the phleng \nbangkhap thang genre. The phleng mai bangkhap thang category comprises phleng Thayoi (เพลงทยอย) \ncompositions. Interestingly, there are also Thai compositions that players must conduct both \nplae thamnong, and strictly play the specific melodic lines that are instructed by their teachers. To \nbest answer your question, I believe you should learn to play Thai instruments. \n \nTC: Yes, thank you! I’ve examined Montri Tramote’s books. He also showcased a few other \ntypes of Thai compositions. What about the category of phleng naphat? Is it possible for Thai \nmusicians to improvise over the thematic melody on such a piece? \n \nSS: Yes, absolutely. In the phleng naphat genre, Thai musicians must improvise (plae thamnong). \nExperienced Thai musicians, in particular, enjoy demonstrating their musical abilities through \nphleng naphat performances. The more experience they have with Thai music, the better they \nare at using the plae thamnong technique. \n \n",
    "321": " \nAPPENDIX B: Interviews \n \n \n305 \nTC: Thank you! I would like to expand on my question regarding the musical composing \napproaches that your teacher taught you. How did your teachers begin teaching you how to \ncompose traditional Thai music? \n \nSS: I think you ask the right person here, because of my research concerning Thai composition \ntechniques. Sanoh Luangsuntorn, a pupil of Luang Pradit Pairoh (Son Silpabanleng), was my \nThai music composition teacher. Again, you must keep in mind that Thai musicians dislike \nwriting things down on paper, so the teaching methods of Thai composition were also \ntransmitted orally from teachers to pupils. However, Sanoh Luangsuntorn, my teacher, was \none of a few Thai composers who wrote about Thai compositional methods. There are a lot \nof different ways to compose Thai music, and I’ll show you some of them. To begin with, 1) \nThai composers create music based on their imaginations. This might be accomplished by Thai \ncomposers beginning to play the sounds they hear on instruments, and then asking their pupils \nto help them in remembering such tunes. 2) composers may take the melodies from old \ncompositions and use them as the basis for new creations. This could be accomplished using a \nvariety of strategies, such as augmentation and diminution techniques, melodic embellishments \n(thang kro, luk leuam), building extra sections (luk yon), and so on. Lastly, composers may use the \nthao compositional method, which is similar to the augmentation and diminution strategies I \ndescribed earlier. However, Thai composers must pay close attention to the sound of luk tok \n(target pitches) when using this method. \n \nTC: Yes, I've learned that several Thai compositional techniques are similar to those employed \nin western music, such as providing a solo passage for instruments (a cadenza). As you \nhave learned western and Thai music, could you please give a brief comment on this? \n \nSS: Yes, I believe it is possible. Montri Tramote and Luang Pradit Pairoh (Son Silpabanleng) \nwere among the Thai composers who observed the growth of western music in Thailand. And, \nI believe they may have absorbed some western influences to some extent. “Saen Kham Nung” \nis one of the examples you could consider. \n \nTC: Moving on to the concept of “nathap,” could you further explain why nathap is so \nsignificant to Thai music composition? \n \n",
    "322": " \nAPPENDIX B: Interviews \n \n \n306 \nSS: It is really crucial. Thai composers relate nathap to a musical boundary, where each Thai \nmelodic phrase must conclude with nathap’s rhythmic rhythms. The melodic patterns of phleng \npropkai compositions, for example, must fully end with the nathap propkai pattern. \n \nTC: One aspect of Thai classical music that fascinates me is the concept of cultural diversity. \nSo, could you kindly elaborate on the musical approaches when performing traditional Thai \nworks with a variety of musical accents? (e.g., samniang Lao, Khmer, Mon, Java, and jin) \n \nSS: Before I go into detail about this concept, you should be aware of the differences \nbetween nationality and ethnicity. I believe that in the past, Thai composers enjoyed imitating \nthe variety of melodic accents they heard all around them. We [Thai composers] then learn to \nmake certain sounds (equivalent to modes) that we may use to imitate the musical \ncharacteristics of those particular groups [starts to sing several compositions in samniang lao, and jin]. \nTaking “Lao Pan” as an example, I believe the goal of this piece is to mimic the sound of \nkhaen's drones. And, you may be mistaken if you believe the khaen is only played in the \nnortheast of Thailand or in modern-day Laos. Several pieces of evidence suggest that khaen \nwas also popular in Bangkok during the Rattanakosin period. Photographs of the khaen \nensemble sent to Europe by King Rama V with a group of Siamese diplomatic envoys are \none example. However, you may need to conduct your own investigation into why khaen’s \ninfluence is decreasing. So, to get back to your question, you may have noticed that the \ndrones sound that Thai composers aim to adapt from lao ethnicity can still be heard in Thai \nclassic music compositions. \n \nTC: Thank you very much! Still pertaining to musical accent topic, you’re a reed player. \nCould you a briefly describe the distinction between pi nai (Thai classical music's reed \ninstrument) and pi nora (a reed instrument used in nora ensembles)? \n \nSS: Again, I believe this has something to do with regional dialect. As you may know, a person \nfrom the center of Thailand speaks with a distinct accent different than someone from the \nsouth. As a result, I believe this method has had a significant impact on how we perform music. \nThe ornamentation employed during performances in these two styles of music appears to be \ndifferent. The ranges used in these two pieces of music are also distinctive. In Thai musical \nensembles, the function of a reed instrument is to imitate vocalists. As a consequence, I believe \nthat having distinct dialects has influenced the playing method. \n",
    "323": " \nAPPENDIX B: Interviews \n \n \n307 \n \nTC: What is the first order of advice that you would give to jazz composers who are interested \nin learning traditional Thai music, to gain a better understanding of this genre? \n \nSS: In response to your question, I believe that learning about “respect” would be beneficial \nto such composers. I don’t mean other things when I say respect; rather, respect yourself for \nhow much Thai classical music you know before embarking on a cross-cultural project. So, \nonce they’ve determined their level, they can select a reasonable degree of Thai classical music \nknowledge to incorporate into their music. This, in my opinion, has nothing to do with a high \nlevel of expertise in Thai classical music. Even if it’s something basic, if you can come up with \ninnovative ways to adapt or apply such musical elements to your music, that’s great. That seems \nto be more appealing to me. The second piece of advice to consider is cultural appropriation. \nAs I previously stated, when working on these kinds of Thai-fusion works, composers should \nconsider their level of Thai classical music. For example, “Sathukan” is a composition whose \nmeaning is “respect.” Therefore, if someone wants to reinterpret this piece, I believe that the \nnotion of respect should be brought over into their crossover pieces as well. \n \nTC: Yes, I am aware that many Thai classical music compositions are tied to a sacred ceremony.  \nAre there any songs that you would warn a cross-cultural composer to avoid? \n \nSS: As in the prior response, you must undoubtedly comprehend a Thai composition on which \nyou intend to work on. The more knowledge you have, the more you will understand what you \nshould and shouldn’t do. In the past, Prince Paribatra arranged a number of Thai compositions \nin naphat category for Western ensembles, and you should keep in mind how conservative \nThailand was at the time. However, today… times have changed, and please do not exploit the \nword “traditions” to construct your own wall. \n \nTC: Please accept my heartfelt gratitude, khru Somnuek. Thank you so much for opportunity to \nspeak with me in this interview. I’ll see you in Thailand. \n \nEnd of Interview  \n \n \n \n",
    "324": " \nAPPENDIX B: Interviews \n \n \n308 \nInterviewee:  Perico Sambeat  \nInterview question: 20 minutes  \nTanarat Chaichana: How did you begin to compose music for a jazz orchestra that \ncombined the musical elements of flamenco and jazz?  \nPerico Sambeat: Well, that came kind of naturally because I’ve been a jazz musician myself. \nI have had deep contact with flamenco music and flamenco for the last 30 years of my career. \nI had a chance to play with many of them and listen to a lot of this music. So, I think it's \nnatural. It happens around the world. I would call it nationalism. Maybe, that’s something \nthat happened in classical music in the 19th century, and it’s also happening now. \nTC: To add to that, is it correct you were born into a household that listened to flamenco \nmusic or grew up listening to flamenco music? \nPS: No, I grew up listening to mostly classical and Latin music, like boleros and all kinds of \nCuban music. I got into flamenco when I was already near 30 years old, and I practiced this \nmusic and studied it the way I studied jazz. \nTC: Actually, this is quite close to me. Even though I was born in Thailand, I never had the \nopportunity to learn about the country’s traditional music when I was a child.  \nTC: Could you please give brief examples of musical elements of flamenco that you apply to \nyour jazz orchestra compositions (e.g., modes, melodic and rhythmic patterns, forms, \ntraditional instruments timbre, etc.)?  \nPS: Well, an example I don’t know. I think you have to know a little of the fundamentals of \nflamenco music to be able to create something that sounds reminiscent of that style. Flamenco \nworks with what is called palo. And, palo is like different rhythms and styles. \nTC: So, you’re saying you compose your works using Flamenco rhythmic patterns? \nPS: Yeah, like another complex one that work is the pattern of siguiriyasing [begins snapping his \nfingers to show this rhythmic pattern]. \n",
    "325": " \nAPPENDIX B: Interviews \n \n \n309 \nTC: Got it. Thank you, let’s move to next question. Do you agree that jazz is artistically and \nmusically able to be absorbed or combined with other musical genres without losing its \nidentity? If yes, what is your reason for this?  \nPS:  You know African rhythm (…) and European harmony, then it got together and happened \nin the south of the United States at the beginning of last century. It had also grown and gotten \nenriched by other artists. For example, Charlie Parker played “la cucaracha.” After that, Stan \nGetz did so many records with Bossa Nova. So, I think jazz is the best tool, and we can have \nto be open-minded. \nTC: Ok. My next question also relates to your original music. I really like your musical \ncompositions and have listened to your performance with the Frankfurt Radio Big Band. Also, \nI saw you put on this performance with Flamenco dances, which I think is very beautiful. So, \nin your original composition, “Tio Petila,” could you please explain what your artistic \ninspirations were and how do you developed musical ideas to compose this music?  \nPS: The idea to compose that music. Well, I have basically the Bulerías pattern, because that \npattern is a little different from the one I mentioned before and this would be something like \n[snapping fingers], and the harmonic rhythm in flamenco is a little different, but I tried to combine \nit in jazz and harmonic. The traditional flamenco harmony sound likes [playing piano]. So, to be \nmore interesting I try to combine that with the Lydian flat two. Then, I created a vamp, moved \nto the fourth minor degree. Yeah, and that's basically how this music was created. \n \nTC: Yeah, and flamenco seems to include a lot of Phrygian sounds as well. Could you comment \non this? \n \nPS: The Phrygian is the one used in flamenco, and it’s also very popular in eastern music. \nTC:  Ok, in terms of composing cross-cultural music for a jazz orchestra, what are common \nissues or prominent obstacles that you have encountered? In particular, when combining \nSpanish with jazz music. \nPS: Well, I think jazz and flamenco have a lot of things in common and a lot of improvisation \ntoo. Um…. I had a little problem. I decided to try not to do it in the very swing way because I \nthink swing doesn’t fit much in flamenco, so most of my record is in even eighths. That’s more \n",
    "326": " \nAPPENDIX B: Interviews \n \n \n310 \nlike Latin jazz or something like that. But, there is some flamenco rhythm (in three-four \npatterns) that I think can be worked with swing, which I did on my previous project. (He \nstarted to play such rhythm on piano). \nTC: Ok. Thank you! So, I’ve got three more questions for this short period. So, this one is \nmore about artistic attitudes than compositional techniques. Starting with the most relaxing \none, what is the most pleasurable feeling that you have ever experienced since you decided to \nbe a jazz composer who combines the musical elements of your country with jazz? \nPS: I think the audience is very open to this kind of cross-cultural thing. Yeah, and the things \nand they really love are definitely the dancer, which I think is a key point. Most of the audience \nreally them. And, they are crazy when the dancer comes out. \n \nTC: Oh, ok! And, this one is about traditionalism vs. modernism. For example, the musical \ntraditions of my country seem to be conservative. And, if you want to change something, you'll \nneed to consider a number of cultural considerations. So, have you ever encountered or \nreceived negative feedbacks from musical traditionalists in your country when working on \ncross-cultural music projects? If yes, what are your reactions and your artistic perspectives \nbased on this issue?  \nPS: Well, I thought about it when I was writing it, which is on the border of respecting the \ntradition and getting into something beyond that. First of all, I think the best thing is to write \nwithout prejudice about all the music that comes to my mind, and if someone doesn’t like it \nI’m sorry, but at the same moment I love jazz, and I love flamenco, and I try to somehow be \nrespectful with both. But, that was not something that I was forced to do. It’s just something \nthat I wanted as a listener. Before my big band project, there were not many people doing big \nbang projects in flamenco and jazz, in my opinion. For example, the Sketches of Spain, and \nsome other things. But none of them were very deep in flamenco. So that was my intent to go \ndeep into the flamenco forms in jazz, which still sounds like flamenco. But, I tell you, I have \nno prejudices about the music that’s in my head. \nTC: Thank you! Moving on to the final question, what is your advice for jazz composers who \nare interested in composing cross-cultural music for a jazz orchestra? And, what should be the \ninitial process of learning to compose such music that you would suggest to them?  \n",
    "327": " \nAPPENDIX B: Interviews \n \n \n311 \nPS: The advice that I would like to give to someone who aspires to be a cross-cultural jazz \ncomposer is that he or she should be concerned in both [types of] music, and he or she should \nstudy both of them deeply, and the more deeply he or she knows, the better he or she does. I \nlike the colorfulness and the complexity of jazz, and that something I want to happen with \nflamenco. Maybe, I have captured only two chords in flamenco, but I think we might have to \nget a task to go a little beyond and get a little far — as much as we can, and know well which \ntraditional music you want to work on and then take it to the complexity and the beauty of jazz \nboth together.

One day, while taking a \nbath in an ancient lake in the mysterious forest of the human realm, Manora is captured by Phran \nBoon, a ferocious hunter, who later hands her over to Pra Suthon, the heir to the Kingdom of \nUttarapancala.As soon as they see each other, they fall in love because of the loving spirit that they \nhad in their past lives. However, a jealous brahmin falsely tells the king, Artit Wong, Pra Suthon’s \nfather, that Manora would bring about a deterioration of his reign and requests the sacrifice of \nManora. So reluctantly, Manora leaves Pra Suthon behind without saying goodbye and secretly flees \nto Mouth Kailash, where humans are unable to go.  \nMonologue 2 (m.215- m.244)  \n“I insistently forbid him to follow me because the journey to the realm of Kinnari, a world of half-bird \nand half-human, is extremely perilous. The route to my world is certainly not for humans, but for \nnon- humans only,” says Manora. However, despite the warning, Pra Suthonstill relentlessly chases \nher and wishes to bring his lover back. Along the way, Pra Suthon encounters several poisonous \nforests and a flooded river where a colossal python lies as an obstacle. Then he must sneak into the \nnest of the gigantic birds in the mythical world, where he must be patient and wait until all ferocious \ncreatures fly away so that he can slowly climb up to the top of Mouth Kailash where he will \neventually be reunited with his love. The journey of Pra Suthon and Manora took seven years, seven \nmonths, and seven days, providing us with a great story of persistence and showing usthe power of \nlove to overcome difference—in this case, between human and non-human.”  \n \n491\n",

Only the empty sky will remind the old to be sad. \n \nOh, my dearest jasmine, why do you have to remind me of the dewdrop on your leaf?  \n \nThe feeling that I used to touch, the delicate fragrance that I used to smell. \n \nIt is at this time that the wind blows and flutters and brings the clouds to the sky, and my eyes \ncould not follow. \n \nDoes no one know how deep is the ocean? Does no one know how deep is your heart? \n \nOh, my dearest dahlia, the flower of my love, the flower I carefully planted, but no one knows \nwho has taken. Now my heart will be broken, and my soul will be lost. \n \nIt is at this time that we nearly see each other, but we still remain apart. \n \nBecause you are the moonset at dawn and I’m the sundown at dusk. Thus, we cannot see each \nother in the same sky. \n \nTanarat C.  \n25/01/2021 \n599\n",
