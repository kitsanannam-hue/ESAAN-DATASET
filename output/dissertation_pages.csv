“People are different, the cosmopolitan knows, and there is much to learn from our differences. Because there 
are so many human possibilities worth exploring, we neither expect nor desire that every person or every society 
should converge on a single mode of life. Whatever our obligations are to others (or theirs to us) they often 
have the right to go their own way. As we will see, there are times when these two ideals—universal concern 
and respect for legitimate difference—clash.”

ABSTRACT 
 
Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand: 
 Exploring hybridizations of Thai music traditions with jazz 
By TANARAT CHAICHANA 
 
 
The objective of this dissertation is to document and critically reflect upon the creation of a 
collection of original works for contemporary jazz orchestra inspired by traditional Thai 
music, following extensive research on Thai music from the perspective of a jazz composer. 
This research, including the musical works, comprises a case study of the musical 
hybridization of Thai music and jazz that can be utilized in both Thai music studies and jazz 
research settings. Despite the increasing interest in Thai-Western musical integration among 
Thai classical composers and ethnomusicologists, no extensive studies have yet explored the 
integration of Thai music with jazz in the context of the contemporary jazz orchestra. 
Furthermore, while some musical traditions, such as those of South Asia and of the Arab 
world, have long been combined with jazz, there have been few such explorations of fusing 
jazz with Thai music traditions.  
 
Unlike previous Thai musical hybridity projects or cross-cultural Thai musical composition 
studies, this research project considers four regional Thai music practices instead of assuming 
the existence of a single “traditional music of Thailand.” I approach such musical practices 
from a jazz composition perspective in this study. In my research methods I identified and 
described their key elements, including fundamental structures, performance methods, and 
idiomatic instruments. I then transcribed performances by prominent Thai musicians 
working in these traditions into Western notation. After that, I experimentally integrated 
such musical elements into jazz compositions and created prototypes before composing 
works for full jazz orchestra. Inspired by the practice of cultural cosmopolitanism in Thailand 
and the openness to foreign cultures witnessed in Thai musical traditions, I also incorporated 
other musical techniques beyond jazz, including elements of rock, hip hop, R&B, and 
electronica, into my contemporary jazz orchestra writing process to produce a unique 
creative output for the study.  
The creative outcome of this research, Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand, consists of seven 
original jazz orchestra compositions totaling 67 minutes. The compositions demonstrate 
musical hybridity in the ways the characteristics of Thai music combine with contemporary 
jazz musical elements to produce new styles. In my critical analysis of these works, I begin 
with general observations on compositional approach and an extensive theoretical analysis 
from the perspective of jazz composition. I go on to comprehensively examine the Thai 
elements that are infused, transformed, or otherwise present in the pieces, and then analyze 
the compositional techniques employed in my musical hybridizations, discussing some of the 
inspirations behind them.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
 
 
First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to two of my doctoral supervisors, 
Dr. Dave Lisik and Dr. Dave Wilson, who are overwhelmingly supportive of me. Without 
them, this research project would not have been possible. Dr. Lisik’s compositional guidance 
has greatly transformed how I think of composing jazz orchestra music from a decent quality 
to a professional one. His methodologies of jazz orchestra music productions have given me 
outstanding knowledge and effective strategies for producing high-quality jazz orchestra 
music, which have significantly benefited me as a jazz composer.  
 
I am also thankful for Dr. Wilson for guiding me and spending time on my research 
component. His mentorship encouraged me to step beyond my comfort zone as a jazz 
performer and embark on a journey as an academic researcher. His advice has also been 
tremendously helpful in my doctoral studies and has assisted me to discover my role as a jazz 
composer. In the preparation of this dissertation, his editorial assistance is also immensely 
appreciated. It was an honor to be a doctoral student of both Dr. Lisik and Dr. Wilson  
in Wellington, New Zealand. 
Second, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my PhD examination committee, 
which included Associate Professor Michael Norris, Professor Dr. Deborah Wong, and 
Professor Dr. Jack Cooper for reviewing both my creative outcomes and research 
component, as well as providing invaluable feedback and suggestions. In addition, I would 
like to express my heartfelt thanks to my previous jazz instructors at the University of New 
Orleans, particularly Professor Steve Masakowski, Edward Petersen, and Associate Professor 
Victor Atkins, who have always supported me in pursuing my academic goals in music and 
spent time completing letters of recommendation for both my portfolios and PhD 
applications in the past.  Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to two 
interviewees, Khru Somnuek Saengarun and Professor Perico Sambeat, for giving their 
valuable time to share their musical expertise in this research project. 
I would like to convey my gratefulness to Assistant Professor Wootichai Lertsatakit and 
Associate Professor Dr. Saksri Vongtaradon for allowing me to take the first steps toward a 
career as a jazz instructor at the Faculty of Music, Silpakorn University, and to teach bass, 
jazz composition and arranging, and university big-band class. This opportunity was a

significant step forward in my academic career, and it motivated my ambition to one day 
become a professional jazz instructor. 
 
Finally, I would like to express my special thanks to all my friends, both musicians and non-
musicians, in Thailand, New Orleans, and Dallas, as well as my Victoria University of 
Wellington PhD fellowships and the Thai community in Wellington, who sincerely believed 
in my passion for music and encouraged me to pursue my dream as a musician. Their love 
and support mean a whole lot to me. And, importantly, I would like to wholeheartedly thank 
my father, mother, sister, aunt, and all my family members for whom I cannot find words to 
express my deepest gratitude. Your love and care mean everything to me, and I owe 
everything I have to you all. I’m so lucky to be part of our family.

NOTES ON TRANSLITERATION 
I employ the Royal General Methodology of Transcription (RTGS) established by the Royal 
Institute of Thailand to transliterate most Thai words in this dissertation. Some words, such 
as ngiew (เงี%ยว) or luk leuam (ลูกเหลื.อม), are difficult to appropriately Romanize. In these cases, I 
provide readers with the original Thai script so that the readers can further explore their 
definitions. I use common transliterations of music terms that do not depart from the RTGS 
system, such as jin (จีน) instead of chin, or jawang (จังหวะ) instead of chawang. This results in 
inconsistent Romanization throughout this dissertation, but using common transliterations 
of music terms assists both readers already familiar with those transliterations, and those 
wishing to learn more about Thai music concepts from existing research.

INTRODUCTION  
 
The advice that I would like to give to someone who aspires to be a cross-cultural jazz composer is that 
he or she should be concerned in both [types of] music, and he or she should study both of them deeply, 
and the more deeply he or she knows, the better he or she does. I like the colorfulness and the complexity 
of jazz, and that something I want to happen with flamenco. Maybe, I have captured only two chords in 
flamenco, but I think we might have to get a task to go a little beyond and get a little far — as much as 
we can, and know well which traditional music you want to work on and then take it to the complexity 
and the beauty of jazz both together. I mean you must know both of them deeply.1

1.1 THE PURPOSE OF STUDY 
 
What musical experiences do jazz composers encounter when learning to compose music 
influenced by Thai musical traditions? What practical methodologies can jazz composers apply 
to compose music in a process of Thai-jazz musical hybridization? How do jazz composers 
balance elements of jazz and traditional Thai music and find a compositional voice when 
working on musical hybridity? What obstacles might a jazz composer confront when 
incorporating elements of traditional Thai music into contemporary jazz orchestra writing? 
These questions form the core of this research project, and I attempt to answer them in this

thesis and in my portfolio of compositions for jazz orchestra, both of which have been 
informed by intensive research into examples and studies of cross-cultural music composition.  
Importantly, my answers to these research questions are based on my artistic experiences as a 
Thai-jazz musician from a modern, middle-class Thai society where the clash between Western 
ideologies and Thai beliefs is on dramatic display. In addition, my mixed family heritages meant 
that I was nurtured in an atmosphere featuring elements of both Thai-Chinese and Southern 
Thai Buddhist cultures, a multicultural background that has had a direct impact on my personal 
identity. 
My jazz experience began at sixteen, the same age I discovered the music of Duke Ellington’s 
jazz orchestra, which became one of my major inspirations to become a jazz orchestra 
composer. Unlike other jazz composers who may have been classically trained as children, I 
began my Western music education as a bass player by learning to transcribe and play along to 
recordings of alternative rock, indie pop, and African-American music, including R&B, soul, 
and hip-hop. I believe this has had a significant effect on my musical development and a direct 
impact on my compositional process, as evidenced by the original compositions I have 
produced for this research. As a result, all of these personal influences are reflected in my 
artistic viewpoints and help establish my positioning as an artist, which has a consequence on 
this investigation. 
In this introductory chapter, I first provide a brief overview of various historical precedents for 
this project, including examples of cross-cultural musical hybridization from early jazz to the 
present day, and a brief discussion of the general lack of cross-cultural works for jazz orchestra 
involving Thai music. I then discuss the methodology of this project and the outline of this thesis, 
before brief discussions of my use of the terms “cross-cultural” and “musical hybridization,” as 
well as my own positionality towards Thai musical traditions as a Thai person trained primarily 
in jazz composition and performance.   
1.2 HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS FOR CROSS-CULTURAL JAZZ 
COMPOSITIONS 
Though jazz is and has always been African American music, the process of composing jazz 
has involved and been influenced by diverse musical elements beyond the musical practices of 
African Americans. These distinct musical influences include, for example, the French

quadrille, as evidenced, for example, in Sidney Bechet’s “Panther Dance” (1949), of which the 
composer remarked, “in fact, it is an old French quadrille, originally known as Praline and said 
to have been inspired by ‘La Marseillaise [sic].’”2 March forms are used in the ragtime 
compositions of Scott Joplin, such as his famous “Maple Leaf Rag” (1899), and the three-
stroke rhythmic patterns (tresillos) in Jelly Roll Morton’s “New Orleans Blues” show the clear 
influence of Caribbean music.3 In addition, musical elements from the Caribbean also played a 
prominent role in the musical hybrids of the swing and bebop styles. Various Caribbean 
elements appear in several well-known early swing compositions, including “The Peanut 
Vendor” (1931) and “Caravan” (1936), which were famously performed by Duke Ellington’s 
orchestra, and “Chili-Con Conga” (1939), performed by Cab Calloway’s orchestra.  
Some of the best illustrations of musical hybridization in bebop can be found in the music of 
Dizzy Gillespie in the 1940s and 1950s, who was introduced to Afro-Cuban music by Mario 
Bauzá. After starting his own band in 1947, Dizzy met Chano Pozo, a Cuban singer, dancer, 
and percussionist who helped Dizzy to invent “Cubop,” a clear example of musical hybridity. 
Afro-Cuban tumbao bass lines and the conga, an Afro-Cuban instrument of African origin, 
were used alongside bebop improvisation and with other complex rhythms in a fast swing 
context. Better-known examples of this hybridization process in Gillespie’s music include “A 
Night in Tunisia” (1942) and “Manteca” (1947). Cubop became widespread during the late 
1940s and significantly influenced jazz composers and orchestra leaders, including George 
Russell and Stan Kenton.4  
Flamenco is another musical style, in this case from Spain, that has been combined with jazz 
styles in several well-known cases. Cross-cultural works combining flamenco and jazz include 
Lionel Hampton’s “Jazz Flamenco” (1956), John Coltrane’s “Olé” (1961), some elements of 
Charles Mingus’s album Tijuana Moods (recorded 1957, released 1962) and the jazz orchestra 
work Sketches of Spain, a 1960 collaboration between Miles Davis and Gil Evans.  
 
Stylistic crossovers in compositional processes among jazz composers continued and further 
expanded in musical style in the 1960s and 1970s. Don Ellis was active in this vein, with

examples including his orchestra’s “Indian Lady” (1967) and “Turkish Bath” (1967, composed 
by Ron Myers), both of which feature an Indian sitar with a jazz orchestra. Ellis’s group also 
performed “Bulgarian Bulge” (1969), which drew on Bulgarian folk rhythms. Other jazz 
composers like Toshiko Akiyoshi and Salah Ragab also brought musical elements from their 
home countries, Japan and Egypt, respectively, into jazz compositions. These include 
Akiyoshi’s Kogun (1974), in which she employed Japanese traditional percussion instruments 
and the Japanese traditional singing style called nohgaku. Egyptian Jazz, by Salah Ragab and the 
Cairo Jazz band (recorded in 1968 and reissued 2017 by Art Yard Records), is an example of 
Egyptian music performed by a large jazz ensemble, and of Middle Eastern influence on jazz 
orchestra music.  
The embrace of diverse musical practices in jazz composition has continued to the present, as 
seen in the more recent performance of “Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton 
Marsalis” (2013) featuring the Sachal Ensemble, a traditional music ensemble from Pakistan. 
In this performance, audiences witness the intermingling of blues from the saxophones and 
brass sections of the jazz orchestra, the musical language of bebop, including improvisation, 
and a strong swing feel with the sound of traditional Pakistani instruments such as the bansuri, 
tabla, and sitar, instruments which also have connections with other South Asian traditions such 
as Hindustani classical music and Carnatic music. Another recent example of a cross-cultural 
music project is the collaboration between German Frankfurt Radio Big Band (hr-Bigband) 
and the renowned Lebanese oud player Rabih Abou-Khalil, playing works arranged and directed 
by Jim McNeely, a prominent American composer of jazz orchestra music. 
The flexibility of jazz and the openness of jazz musicians to seemingly endless musical 
influences from around the world can be witnessed in the multicultural practices of jazz 
throughout its history. Duke Ellington also comments on the concept of its musical diversity:  
Jazz is a tree, and it has many branches that reach out many directions, of course, it goes 
into the far east and picks up its exotic blossom, and at the end of each branch is a twig. 
It goes east, west, north, south, and everywhere it goes it pick up some certain influence. 
[…] As it goes down into the deep roots into the earth then you find out these blue-
blooded black roots are deep in the soil of black Africa which is of course the foundation 
of everything that is with the beat. The beat that of course today is the most listened to 
in the world.5

Other jazz musicians, on the other hand, may strive to absorb other musical traditions in order 
to gain new perspectives or innovations that can be integrated into their creative practices, as 
John Coltrane described: 
I like Ravi Shankar very much. When I hear his music, I want to copy it—not note for note of course, 
but in his spirit. What bring me closest to Ravi is the modal aspect of his art. Currently, at the particular 
stage I find myself in, I seem to be going through a modal phase … There’s a lot of modal music that is 
played every day throughout the world. It’s particularly evident in Africa, but if you look at Spain or 
Scotland, India or China, you’ll discover this again in each case.6 
Despite the numerous examples of cross-cultural jazz projects mentioned above, there still 
remains a dearth of such hybrids of jazz and traditional Thai music, particularly with regard to 
contemporary jazz orchestra compositions that have yet to be explored in jazz research. In fact, 
even with the presence of jazz since the 1930s in Bangkok, jazz was initially only performed by 
a small number of people in Thailand, and the music was appreciated mostly by those in the 
elite or middle classes who had earned diplomas in Western countries.7 After decades of jazz 
activity in Thailand, the College of Music at Mahidol University eventually established the first 
Thai jazz studies program in 1998. This was the first music institution in Thailand where music 
students could enroll in jazz courses and earn a Bachelor of Arts (BA).8 Yet, extensive research 
that is focused on cross-cultural jazz orchestra compositions is still rare in Thai jazz education. 
For these reasons, this research offers an opportunity to experiment, develop, and produce 
creative works that significantly contribute to the field of cross-cultural music composition. 
Therefore, the explicit purpose of this study is fourfold: 1) to create a new work that is the 
result of the musical hybridization of jazz and Thai music traditions; 2) to apply knowledge of 
traditional Thai music to jazz compositions; 3) to demonstrate through comprehensive musical 
analysis how the characteristics of Thai music are reproduced and adapted in jazz orchestra 
pieces; and 4) to offer a jazz composer’s experiential account of working in musical hybridity.  
1.3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  
My research methodology for this project has been drawn from multiple sources. Just as I did 
earlier in my life when first acquiring a jazz vocabulary as a bass player and composer, I set 
about learning Thai music by transcribing recordings of compositions to develop a better 
understanding of how such music works from a jazz composer’s perspective. This process is

similar to the notion of “imitation to assimilation to innovation” proposed by Walter Bishop 
Jr., an American jazz pianist, who elaborates the concept as follows: 
It all goes from imitation to assimilation to innovation. You move from the imitation stage to the 
assimilation stage when you take little bits of things from different people and weld them into an 
identifiable style-creating your own style.9  
Next, I assess these transcriptions from the perspectives of Thai musicians in order to gain a 
practical understanding of how Thai music is genuinely performed. I then restate these new 
findings in jazz terminology, which I believe the majority of my readers, who are jazz 
practitioners, will be able to understand. As with recordings of a jazz standard, Thai recordings 
exist in several renditions, each performed differently depending on how the performers were 
taught by their masters, or if they are music teachers themselves, their own interpretation. The 
Thai recordings I selected for my study had a profound influence on this research. To provide 
a practical approach for this study, I chose Thai music recordings that were performed by well-
respect Thai musicians or recorded by Thai music ensembles established by Thai universities 
with Thai music studies programs. 
The second element of my methodology is a study of the existing literature on Thai music. A 
number of publications by both Western and Thai scholars who are experts in the field, such 
as Montri Tramote, David Morton, Terry E. Miller, Panya Roongruang, Anant Narkkong, 
Deborah Wong, Kumkom Pornprasit, and John Garzoli, to name a few, also played a crucial 
role in helping me to acquire extensive knowledge of Thai music. I reference these experts’ 
arguments and discussions in several chapters of this research. The scope of such discussions 
is also extended to the historical and social aspects of Thai musical practice, to present a clearer 
picture of Thai performers’ musical purpose and identity. In addition, I returned to Thailand 
in 2019 to conduct archival research in multiple libraries in Thailand. On this trip, I uncovered 
several Western-notated scores (transcriptions) of significant Thai works, which I also studied 
and employed in my compositional process. 
 
To gain a perspective on genuine Thai music-making practice and issues surrounding the 
cultural appropriation of Thai music traditions, I also interviewed Somuek Saengarun, a 
prominent Thai classical musician who has worked in several cross-cultural music projects both 
in Thailand and overseas. This interview also revealed much about the attitudes of Thai classical

musicians toward musical hybridization or cross-cultural music works, the stylistic difference 
between Thai classical music and other regional traditional Thai music, and some successful 
Western musical approaches to Thai classical music. This interview also revealed much about 
the attitudes of Thai classical musicians toward musical hybridization or cross-cultural music 
works, the stylistic difference between Thai classical music and other regional traditional Thai 
music, and some successful Western musical approaches to Thai classical music. 
In my approach to studies of jazz composition, I explored previous cross-cultural jazz orchestra 
projects through score study and listening, with special attention to aspects of cross-cultural 
music making. This process yielded a clearer picture of the compositional processes employed 
in integrating culturally distinct musical elements. I also further investigated the perspectives 
of the composers of these projects in articles and related dissertations.  
Scholarly work on the notion of the globalization of jazz and the adaptation of jazz to local 
music cultures also provided significant contributions to this research. Scholars in this field 
such as Stuart Nicholson, E. Taylor Atkins, and Bruce Johnson led me to discover more cross-
cultural jazz composers, to review the historical background of jazz-influenced music outside 
the United States, and to examine artistic attitudes toward the products and processes of 
crossovers between jazz and the local music cultures of Scandinavia, Japan, and Australia. 
In parallel to my investigations of Thai music, I interviewed a prominent cross-cultural jazz 
composer, Perico Sambeat, a professor at Berklee College of Music in Valencia who has 
recorded several successful jazz orchestra albums that contained elements of flamenco and 
jazz. In this interview, Perico explicitly demonstrated several compositional processes through 
which he incorporates flamenco musical elements into his jazz orchestra works. He also offered 
his artistic perspective on the argument between traditionalism and modernism in the criticism 
and perception of cross-cultural music.10  
For the compositional analysis and discussion of my original compositions, which is the 
cornerstone of this research, I chose to adopt the practical methods of musical analysis of 
Rayburn Wright’s Inside the Score (1982), Richard Lawn’s Jazz Score and Analysis (2018), and Bill 
Dobbins’s Composing and Arranging for the Contemporary Big Band (2014), all of which are widely 
used in jazz composition studies. Such discussions will begin with general observations on my

compositional approaches, including artistic inspiration, melody, harmony, and rhythm, and 
will examine specific composition techniques, as well as providing a detailed account of the 
elements of Thai music that are infused, transformed, or otherwise present in the pieces. 
1.4 CREATIVE PROCESS 
My creative approach to this project, which I regard as an innovative stage, is also based on my 
own belief in philosophical pragmatism, which I have consistently applied in my teaching and 
performing. For a pragmatist, outcomes are examined through practical concerns and 
theoretical findings must be validated by their practical consequences. A pragmatist is also 
interested in putting concepts, theories, and techniques to the test to discover how well they 
perform in practice. As William James, a significant contributor to the development of 
pragmatism, says, “True ideas are those that we can assimilate, validate, corroborate, and verify. 
False ideas are those that we cannot.”11 
As a result, my musical work, Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand, is the product of the practical 
results that have been implemented into the four distinct processes, including:  
1) selecting a Thai composition that contains musical features that are presumed to 
function in a jazz context;  
2) transcribing such Thai recordings in order to gain a better understanding in terms 
of practical consideration, and then analyzing the transcripts from a jazz 
perspective;  
3) composing a preliminary or prototype work for a small ensemble using features of 
Thai music revealed through transcriptions and combined with jazz musical 
elements;  
4) producing musical works for a jazz orchestra by expanding on these Thai music 
elements and assimilating new Thai music ideas that can be practically incorporated 
into the jazz composition process. 
Furthermore, my intention in composing the music for this research project is clear: I would 
like to produce music that not only provides audiences with an experience of Thai sonorities, 
but also goes beyond traditional features of the jazz orchestra repertoire by offering

contemporary jazz harmonies and incorporating other musical elements, such as alternative

1.5 THESIS STRUCTURE  
 
Unlike previous Thai musical hybridity projects or cross-cultural Thai musical composition 
studies12, the scope of this research project considers four regional Thai music practices (I 
consider Thai classical music to be one of these regional practices) instead of assuming the 
existence of a single “traditional music of Thailand.” The reason behind this is that I would 
like to pay equal attention to an array of Thai music traditions, recreating the sound of these 
four regional Thai music practices as befits my thesis title, “Jazz Orchestra Portraits of 
Thailand.” In addition, my study adopts a jazz composition perspective rather than serving as 
an ethnomusicological investigation. However, as suggested by Perico Sambeat in his interview 
with me, “The advice that I would like to give to someone who aspires to be a cross-cultural 
jazz composer is that he or she should be concerned in both [types of] music, and he or she 
should study both of them deeply, and the more deeply he or she knows, the better he or she 
does.”13 Therefore, my attention in this study may go beyond the purely compositional 
viewpoints to investigate those aspects of wider culture and society that might help jazz 
composers to understand how these musicians genuinely practice their music.  
This thesis is divided into seven chapters, with this introduction serving as Chapter 1. In 
Chapter 2, a literature review, I begin by examining a case study of previous cross-cultural 
music projects and artistic experiments to demonstrate how jazz can be combined with other 
musical elements: flamenco; Scandinavian music (Nordic tones); the traditional music of 
Bulgaria, Indian, Japan, and Indonesia; and Australian folk music. This is followed by a 
discussion of literature on cross-cultural composition studies in Thailand, with several 
examples of Thai composers’ attitudes on cross-cultural music projects. I conclude this chapter 
by discussing a selection of publications by Thai ethnomusicologists and Western scholars,

namely David Morton, Terry E. Miller, Panya Roongruang, and John Garzoli, whose work has 
played a significant role in my research. 
Chapter 3 begins with a discussion of the cultural cosmopolitanism practiced in the ancient 
Siamese Kingdom, which has resulted in the openness to foreign cultures witnessed in Thai 
music traditions. I also briefly discuss the formation of the modern Thai nation with reference 
to the work of Sujit Wongthes, David K. Wyatt, Chris Baker, and Pasuk Phongpaichit. Later, 
I embark upon a discussion of Thai classical music (dontri thai doem) with reference to the pitch 
production of Thai instruments and the characteristic melodic lines (which I refer to as “Thai 
melodic patterns”) implemented in lyrical compositions, as well as texture, rhythm, meter, 
compositional techniques, and musical form. I situate these musical characteristics as vital to 
this project, as they lend themselves well to processes of hybridization of Thai classical music 
with jazz orchestra music. I then discuss two “prototype compositions” of mine, where I 
experiment with applying principles of Thai classical music to jazz material in preparation for 
composing my own larger-scale works. The first composition applies the augmentation and 
diminution techniques employed in thao compositions to John Coltrane’s composition “Giant 
Steps.” The second composition, “Nanapa,” uses several Thai classical music composition 
techniques such as thang kro (tremolo), luk thao (sustained pitches), and luk lo luk kut (call and 
response). 
Chapter 4 examines the traditional music of northeast Thailand (dontri isan nuea), beginning with 
a general description of the musical practice in this region, drawing on the work of Charoen 
Chaichonphairote. I then discuss the idiomatic instruments of dontri isan, such as khaen, phin, 
pong lang, and klong hang. I then consider the concept of lai (similar to the notion of a mode) as 
implemented in isan music, analyze the improvisation of khaen (bamboo mouth organ) 
performance performed by Sombat Simlah, and illustrate pragmatic approaches to combining 
the melodic lines of traditional music of northeast Thailand, including “Lai Lom Phat Phrao,” 
“Lai Nok Sai Bin Kham Thung (ลายนกไซบินข้ามทุ่ง),” and “Lai Teay Khong,” with contemporary 
jazz harmony.  
 
In Chapter 5, which discusses the traditional music of southern Thailand, I trace the Thai 
Buddhist performance methods of nora music, in particular the khuen hua pi technique, and 
present my transcription of “Patcha,” a traditional nora piece transcribed from performances 
by Umnad Nuniad, a prominent nora musician. I also provide a brief overview of Thai Muslim

11 
rong ngeng performances, including their musical instruments, textures, rhythms and 
compositional repertories, before presenting two prototype compositions, which employ 
Western instruments to imitate the performance methods of musical instruments of southern 
Thailand. 
 
Chapter 6 assesses the performance methods, such as khap saw, used in the traditional music 
of northern Thailand as detailed in research by Kumkom Pornprasit, and demonstrates the 
stylistic particularities of the salo pin ensemble. For a selection of musical instruments, I then 
provide a brief description of their performance practices, illustrated by transcriptions of 
performances of the pi jum (free-reed pipe), salo (three-stringed spike fiddle), and sueng (plucked, 
fretted lute). I also include my transcriptions of “Saw Dad Nan” and “Saw Pan Fai,” two well-
known compositions in repertoires of northern Thai traditional music. As in previous chapters, 
I offer one example of how the musical elements of northern Thailand can be incorporated 
with musical elements of jazz, in this case, in the context of a small jazz ensemble.  
 
Chapter 7 provides a musical analysis of my creative works for this project, which consists of 
seven contemporary jazz orchestra pieces that illustrate the use of characteristics of Thai music 
traditions from three different regions, as well as from Thai classical music. Four of these seven 
compositions are influenced by Thai classical music: “Buang-Suang” (“Deity Worship”), a 
ritual and worship music paying respect to the music gods, the great teachers, and the three 
gems of Buddhism; “Phuen Ban” (“Village Song”), a conventional big band composition 
inspired by the character of Thai melodies; “Samniang Jin” (“Porcelain”), a contemporary jazz 
piece adopting a transcultural Thai-Chinese music process, and influenced by “Choet Jin (เชิด
จีน),” a Thai classical music piece with a Chinese accent; and “Patchim” (“Epilogue”), farewell 
music inspired by two Thai classical works, “Tao Kin Pak Buk,” and “Pra Artit Ching Duang.” 
The other three compositions are inspired by the three regions of traditional music of this 
study. These include “Mekong” (“River of Souls”), a musical interpretation of northeast 
Thailand, consisting of several remarkable traditional melodies and significantly influenced by 
the idiomatic instruments of khaen and phin;  “Singora” (“Dance of Kinnari”), a contemporary 
jazz orchestra piece, influenced by pi nora performances and illustrating the multicultural 
practice of south Thailand, where the musical cultures of Thai Buddhists (nora) and Muslims 
(rong ngeng) are exchanged; and “Wiang Haeng” (“The Northern Rhapsody”), a contemporary

12 
jazz composition inspired by the performance practice of traditional northern Thai music and 
depicting the mountain ranges and valleys of the region.14 
 
In Chapter 8, I conclude with a final critical analysis and account of my musical experiences 
while working on these musical hybridization projects. I reflect on the compositional 
experiences when distinct musical elements collided, describe the obstacles that I encountered, 
suggest which methods may be effective in further compositional processes, and finally offer 
several insights that may be of benefit to future jazz composers working on cross-cultural 
projects. 
 
1.6 KEY TERMS  
 
In this written exegesis I employ the two English terms “cross-cultural” and “musical 
hybridization” (or “hybridity”). Though the term “cross-cultural” is primarily associated with 
psychology and social science, it has also been employed in musicology, in particular when 
referring to the crossover between Western and non-Western music. Jin-Ah Kim remarks on 
the term “cross-cultural” in her essay, “Cross-cultural Music Making: Concepts, Conditions, 
and Perspectives”:15 
 
Originally, it was used in empirical studies in order to compare different cultures based on 
statistics. Over the course of time, however, in particular since the 1980s, the term has been 
increasingly used in the sense of interaction and integration between culture.16 
 
I find the term “cross-cultural” useful to some extent, though I understand that “cultures” are 
more flexible, elastic, and porous than the concept implies, especially in particular forms of 
jazz, which is indeed a multicultural music genre. However, after spending four years living in 
New Orleans, where many people agree that the origin of jazz is certainly associated with 
multiculturalism, I have found that it is critical to clearly identify jazz as an African American 
musical tradition.17 For example, Nicholas Payton, a New Orleans native trumpeter underlined

the importance of African American aspects in jazz, claiming that “The most important part 
to me is the black part. And that’s not to say who can and cannot play this music. But without 
addressing the community part and who created the music — that’s wrong.”18   
 
Jazz researcher Lewis Porter also advises jazz scholars that, when conducting  research on jazz, 
it is critical to view this music from a black perspective as much as possible.19 My stance is that 
jazz is clearly African American music, and therefore, when I try to illustrate the process of 
making music that combines jazz (African American music traditions) with other musical 
elements, I still consider that the term “cross-cultural” may be useful for readers to understand 
how two distinct musical elements are integrated or to which degree those two musical 
elements are combined.  
 
The origin of the word “hybridity” is the Latin hybrida, which identifies the offspring of a 
domestic sow and a wild boar.20 According to Jean-Paul Baldacchino, although this word was 
applied to celebrate the mixture of cultures and languages, the word hybridity also renders it 
problematic, in particular in the context of nineteenth-century racial discourse. However, in 
the age of globalization, as Baldacchino explains, this word commonly refers to “cultural 
differences,” “cultural fusion,” or “celebrat[ing] diversity.”21 Although the word hybridity is 
not a perfect description of my work, and despite the potential negative connotations, it 
appears to better reflect the nature of my creative works than related words such as “cross-”, 
“inter-”, “trans-” or “fusion”, because my works are indeed the product of the combination of 
more than two distinct musical cultures to establish a new musical language that sounds distinct 
from its constituent parts. Moreover, I consider this word to offer a “third space” for this 
project, a new dimension where my jazz composition knowledge encounters Thai music 
tradition practices in order to create new musical works that are autonomous in terms of both 
authenticity and authorship.22 Recognizing that both are imperfect concepts, I generally use

“cross-cultural” when referring to jazz compositions that provide a sense of interaction or 
integration of distinct cultures, and “musical hybridization” or “hybridity” to my original 
works. 
Another potentially confusing term is “traditional music of Thailand” or “traditional Thai 
music,” which some jazz musicians may consider to be “Thai classical music” (dontri thai doem), 
primarily practiced in the center of Thailand. For those interested in jazz approaching my work, 
I hope to expand their understanding of Thai traditional music, to better understand the main 
traditional practices in Thailand, in their typical categorization into four regions (dontri si pak 
ดนตรีสี6ภาค), described previously. In fact, even though English-language studies of Thai classical 
music research are numerous, studies of regional traditional Thai music, in particular the study 
of the traditional music of southern Thailand, where nora and rong ngeng are practiced, are 
lacking. Consequently, by contributing this research, I hope that the “other traditional Thai 
music,” which is practiced outside the area of the center of Thailand will draw more attention 
from music researchers in the future.23    
1.7 PERSONAL STATEMENT  
Because my works are directly associated with Thai musical practices, I would like to provide 
a personal statement regarding Kwarm pen Thai (Thainess). Indeed, the perception of Thainess 
and Thai identity are ambiguous depending on the experiences and value system of individual 
artists. However, John Garzoli emphasizes the importance of such a concept which he 
explained that “Thai musicians regard this concept (Thainess) as being central to the creation 
and evaluation of their work” and “Thai musicians generally had clear views about what is ‘real 
Thai’ and what was not.”24 Therefore, it is also important to me to present my personal attitude 
toward the interpretation of my works, and state my position on Thai music traditions.  
As a Thai student who grew up in a modern society in Bangkok, I learned the concept of Thai 
identity through the standard Thai school curriculum, which is to some degree associated with 
nationalism.25 However, since I have spent more time studying outside these standard 
                                                        
23 Aside from these four groups of musical traditions, there are several ethnic minority music practices in Thailand, 
such as Karen, Hmong, Akha, and Lawa musical cultures, which also require further research.

curriculum contexts, and evaluated Thai cultures from my empirical observations, my 
perspective on Kwarm pen Thai (Thainess) has started to embrace the concept of 
multiculturalism. What makes Thai cultures fascinating to me is that they are results of the 
practice of cultural diversity which can be witnessed both in the past and in present-day 
Thailand. As I have embraced this diversity more deeply, multiculturalism is also reflected in 
my works, in which I try to demonstrate the influences on my creativity of traditions beyond 
Thai music and jazz, such as Latin American music, alternative rock, and hip-hop.  
Moreover, I would like to highlight that the creative works of this project should not be 
interpreted as a work of nationalism, as in examples where a Thai person tries to promote Thai 
culture. I have decided to conduct this research because, regardless of my nationality, I have 
been inspired by other types of traditional music, in particular, in the southeast Asian region. 
Additionally, I assume that attempting to determine the border of such traditional music 
practices by using a modern concept of national borders would be a major mistake, as I shall 
highlight how cultural diversity influenced Thai music tradition’s musical practices in Chapter 
3. To me, it seemed logical, in composing hybrid jazz I consider to be global, to start with Thai 
musical traditions, since I am able to draw on Thai musical knowledge written in Thai or shared 
verbally in Thai. I am also able to find suitable Thai musicians’ recordings that can serve as 
compelling resources for future jazz compositions (by me and other jazz composers), even as 
I have spent most of my time conducting this research in Wellington, New Zealand. In 
addition, I believe that we do not need to be native-born to legitimately learn traditional music. 
Every kind of musical knowledge, indeed, requires significant time and effort to master. Yet, 
in my opinion, the most important thing we need to do is clearly comprehend such musical 
knowledge and approach it ethically with consideration of our positionalities.  
That being said, I would like to clarify my position as “an outsider” to Thai music traditions. 
Even though I am Thai and grew up in Thailand, I neither had opportunities to attend any 
ritual ceremonies (wai khru)26 nor have a family heritage in Thai music. In addition, the almost 
nine years I have spent outside Thailand (five in the USA and nearly four in New Zealand) 
have changed how I think about Thai cultures. Even if I consider myself an “outsider” to Thai 
music traditions, this does not necessarily imply that I am somehow beyond the social-cultural 
boundaries of Thai practices, as I was nurtured in a middle-class Thai household with Thai 
                                                        
26 A wai khru is a ceremony of paying homage and respect to music teacher. The ceremonies intend to honor 
teachers while is allow pupils to ask for their teacher’s blessing. See Chapter 3, in the sacred ceremonies section.

customs. I also acknowledge that what I see as intellectual Thai knowledge has emerged from 
the practice of multiculturalism in Thailand. As a result, I would like to stress that this study 
should not be misinterpreted as having been produced by someone working entirely outside 
of their own culture, which might have connotations of cultural exploitation and colonialism. 
I would like also to underline that while I employ Western music notation to describe Thai 
musical practices from a jazz standpoint, I have no intention of overlooking or denigrating 
Thai musical knowledge. My purpose is clear: I employ this method to transfer Thai music 
practices into a musical language accessible to jazz practitioners. As a consequence, this is the 
work of a modern Thai striving to develop his personal identity by reconciling his ancestor’s 
legacy with his own beliefs.  In addition, my personal approach to these musical hybridizations 
is that of a contemporary artist working in Thai music traditions and their innovative potential 
rather than an artist seeking to adopt a purist or traditional perspective. Furthermore, my 
creative work should be understood as generated from the perspective of a jazz composer 
seeking new ways to create music for a jazz orchestra and exploring Thai musical elements to 
incorporate into his jazz compositions. 
Finally, I would like to mention that the overriding concern when making music for this project 
is “to be respectful”; as I discovered, the concept of obedience and discipline is considered a 
core value of Thai music traditions. In addition, I would like to pay my respects to Thai music 
teachers who create and develop the knowledge of these styles of music, and to inform those 
who continue to uphold Thai music traditions that my creative works constitute a 
contemporary music project produced by a jazz musician genuinely fascinated by Thai music 
traditions. The aim of this work is to introduce the aspects of Thai music into another branch 
in the tree of jazz, as Duke Ellington put it, adding Thai music traditions, through my 
knowledge of jazz composition and my individual artistic expression, to the many languages 
that characterize jazz today. Even after completing this project, I still believe that there is much 
that I can learn from Thai musical traditions, and much that can be applied to my jazz 
composition process.

2.1 INTRODUCTION  
 
This chapter is an overview of cross-cultural jazz composition, and is divided into four sections. 
In the first section, a review of cross-cultural jazz orchestra literature, I explore several books, 
essays and dissertations that examine the amalgamation of jazz and other musical elements, 
namely, flamenco, Scandinavian music (the so-called “Nordic tone”), the traditional music of 
Bulgaria, and musical traditions of India and Australia. Next, I approach case studies of cross-
cultural jazz orchestra projects in Asia, discussing and analyzing two prominent projects—the 
works of the Japanese musicians and composer Toshiko Akiyoshi and the Indonesian group 
Krakatau. In the third section, which covers literature on cross-cultural composition studies in 
Thailand, I discuss research that focusses on cross-cultural processes in Thailand from the 
appearance of Catholic missionaries during the Ayutthaya period (1350 to 1767) until the Thai

Cultural Revolution during the Phibulsongkhram regime. I also provide a brief observation of 
previous works of prominent Thai classical composers and well-known recent Thai fusion 
bands that have had an impact on the Thai cross-cultural music scenes. In the final section—
which relates to the literature on Thai music studies—I demonstrate how the significant

2.2 A REVIEW OF CROSS-CULTURAL JAZZ ORCHESTRA LITERATURE 
 
The musical practices of Andalusians, principally flamenco, have long attracted the attention 
of jazz performers, composers, and researchers. For example, in Peter Manuel’s 2016 essay 
“Flamenco Jazz: An Analytical Study,”28 the author provides a comprehensive insight into how 
the two distinct musical styles have been combined. In this study, Manuel evaluates the artistic 
attitudes and works from the early stages of Paco de Lucía’s musical hybrids in the 1970s, and 
provides observations on several of Chick Corea’s compositions and the artistic movement of 
flamenco jazz in the 1990s. In discussions of this movement, he concentrates on pianist and 
composer Chano Domínguez, and describes him as responsible for “the true flowering of 
Flamenco jazz” in his successful adaptation of the bulerías, a flamenco rhythm, into the blues, 
as well as in his use of jazz harmonies to accompany malagueña, a traditional singing style. 
Manuel then extensively demonstrates the compatible and incompatible concepts between jazz 
and flamenco, comparing the musical forms and harmonic construction of the styles with one 
another. In addition, Manuel provides a comprehensive analysis of a solo by pianist Alex 
Conde, a prominent flamenco jazz artist. This improvisation illustrates the use of idiosyncratic 
jazz and flamenco elements as well as the application of the bulería rhythm over the chordal 
resources of the Phrygian mode. 
 
Stephanie Stein Crease explores the significance of using a Spanish-influenced style in a jazz 
orchestra album in her discussion of Miles Davis and Gil Evans’s Sketches of Spain (1960). 29  
Crease discusses the album’s musical adaptation of Saeta (the religious music of Andalusians) 
and its musical interpretation of Soleá (a traditional flamenco form). These two musical 
elements significantly influenced the creation of two compositions from Sketches of Spain,

namely, “Saeta,” and “Soleá.” Crease then highlights a statement by Miles Davis regarding his 
initial experience working with Spanish influences, which required musical expressions similar 
to singing as well as performance techniques quite disparate from those typical of jazz. In 
Davis’s words: 
 
Now that was the hardest thing for me to do on Sketches of Spain. To play the parts on the trumpet where 
someone was supposed to be singing, especially when it was ad-libbed, like most of the time… After we 
finished working on Sketches of Spain, I didn’t have nothing inside of me. I was drained of all emotion 
and I didn’t want to hear that music after I got through playing all that hard shit.30 
Sergio Pamies Rodriguez’s dissertation on flamenco jazz provides further insight on this 
particular cross-cultural music. He explores the historical integration of these two musical 
styles—despite the lack of agreement between critics and journalists in classifying this particular 
genre from an anthropological perspective.31 In Rodriguez’s words, “while critics and 
journalists have articulated some of their critiques according to the expectations of the [genre] 
label instead of the quality of the music, the musicians do not seem to give any importance to 
the label itself.”32 Rodriguez’s research also shares Chick Corea’s commentary on descriptions 
of this crossover music: 
The flamenco goes this way, and the jazz goes this way, but then, later they meet. Now in the world they 
meet. When me and Paco meet, we play music—I don’t know what you call it. People call it flamenco 
jazz... but it’s definitely some of my favorite ways to make music.33 
In his musical analytic approach, Rodriguez illustrates successful cases in which the two musical 
elements have been synthesized. For example, he discusses the adaptation of bebop language 
in the improvisations of Jorge Pardo—a Spanish flute and saxophone player—and the 
utilization of flamenco guitar approaches, such as alzapúa and picados which Chick Corea 
incorporated for his solo on “Touchstone” (1982) from his album of the same name. Rodriguez 
also examines the work of Pedro Iturralde, a well-known Spanish saxophonist. He explains 
Iturrald’s creative process as similar to Walter Bishop Jr.’s concept, comparable to my research 
methodology as described earlier. To describe Iturralde’s compositional process, Rodriguez 
states:  
Iturralde certainly took elements from Davis and Coltrane’s famous recordings and demonstrated that 
another kind of jazz was possible and showed what would make this new music different. He used the 
flamenco rhythmic elements of its styles (palos), the flamenco melodic gestures, and the flamenco

harmonic possibilities. He combined of all of them in a sophisticated and integrated hybridization with 
jazz performance practices at the highest level… Iturralde attempted to accomplish all of the above, 
introducing more elements from flamenco than any of his predecessors.34 
Importantly, Rodriguez highlights several jazz orchestra projects that contain flamenco 
elements. These compositions and albums include Jazzpaña (1993) by Vince Mendoza and Arif 
Mardin (from the WDR Big Band in Cologne), Victoria Suite (2010) by Chano Domínguez and 
Wynton Marsalis with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, Flamenco Big Band by Perico Sambeat 
(2009), and Bulería, Soleá y Rumba (2004) by Maria Schneider. He argues that the aesthetics of 
flamenco jazz should not be overlooked in jazz education and that this cross-cultural music 
genre has the potential to inspire other international jazz musicians to broaden jazz’s cultural 
diversity.35  
The prominent jazz author and critic Stuart Nicholson has made a significant contribution to 
research on cultural diversity in jazz, from historical analyses to discussions of present-day 
musical practices. One of his underlying concepts is that jazz spread by a process of cultural 
diffusion in what he calls “the Globalization of Jazz.”36 His books and essays—including Is 
Jazz Dead? Or Has It Moved to a New Address? (2005), Jazz and Culture in a Global Age (2005), and 
“Jazz in the Global Village” (Jazz Musicological Symposium, University of Music and Dramatic 
Arts, Graz, Austria, 2009)—are exemplary studies of jazz in cross-cultural forms, and of jazz 
intersecting with local identities around the world. For example, in his book chapter “Fusion 
and Crossovers” in The Cambridge Companion to Jazz,37 Nicholson discusses cross-cultural 
compositions that contain the elements of Swedish traditional music that have been integrated 
with musical vocabulary of jazz. Nicholson’s prominent examples of crossover compositions 
consist of the application of bebop influences and swing rhythm to Swedish-style melodies in 
the 1950s works of Swedish saxophonist Lars Gullin: “Sov Du Lilla Vide Ung” (1952), “Fedja” 
(1956), and “Ma” (1956). Additionally, he notes the recordings of Jan Johansson (a pianist),

36 In addition to Nicholson’s work, recent jazz studies literature related to the concept of the globalization of jazz 
includes Jazz Planet (2003) edited by E. Taylor Atkins, Jazz Diaspora: Music and Globalization (2019) by Bruce 
Johnson, Jazz Cosmopolitanism in Accra: Five Musical Years in Ghana (2012) by Steven Feld, Jazz Worlds/World Jazz 
(2016) edited by Philp Bohlman and Goffredo Plastino, and Yoshiomi Saito’s book The Global Politics of Jazz in the 
Twentieth Century: Cultural Diplomacy and “American Music.” (2019)

21 
which contain a mix of standard jazz repertoires with Swedish folk songs such as, “De Salde 
Sina Hemman,” which generated great interest among international jazz audiences. 
Nicholson also explicitly describes the artistic rendition of Scandinavian musicians’ identities 
in jazz, which he refers to as “the Nordic Tone.” One of the prominent jazz performers to play 
a crucial role in this artistic movement was Jan Garbarek, a Norwegian jazz saxophonist. 
Inspired by folk music of Scandinavia and by his own personal interpretations of the dramatic 
changes in season and natural landscape in Scandinavia, Garbarek evoked the sound of 
tranquility—which contained strong Nordic musical roots—in his improvisations. According 
to Nicholson, the music in Garbarek’s Dis (1977) also witnessed the use of a wind harp to 
describe the sound of the Scandinavian landscape, which Garbarek then intermingled with his 
jazz music vocabulary. Garbarek also provided an interesting statement on blending his musical 
heritage and jazz influences: 
 
You can apply any personal input coming from whatever part of the world, and it’s possible to find a 
way that will work in the jazz idiom. We have players from any part of the world now doing their own, 
shall we say, native version. They find their own direction, influenced by their own culture, but [are] still 
using the very strong basic elements of jazz.38  
Don Ellis’s work provides numerous examples of influence from a wide range of composers 
and traditions. Many of his jazz orchestra compositions were significantly infused with musical 
elements from diverse places, including musical traditions from India, Bulgaria, and Turkey. In 
her 2007 essay “Diversifying the Groove: Bulgarian Folk Meets the Jazz idiom,” Claire Levy 
explains the strong relationship between Ellis and Milcho Leviev, a Bulgarian jazz pianist who 
assisted Ellis in refining and transposing elements from Bulgarian rural music traditions into 
jazz orchestra music. In her essay, Levy also describes the process of making “Bulgarian Bulge,” 
a jazz orchestra composition in 33/16 inspired by “Sadovsko Horo,” a Bulgarian dance. Aside 
from incorporating additive meters of Bulgarian music into jazz orchestra music, Don Ellis 
also—according to Sean Felson’s doctoral dissertation on Ellis’s rhythmic approach—
extensively researched Hindustani music to find alternative approaches to rhythmic concepts 
in jazz.39 For example, Ellis explains “I learned from Harihar Rao how to superimpose 
complicated rhythmic patterns on one another, ways of counting to be able to keep my place

22 
in a given cycle no matter how long or involved, and how to arrive at new rhythmic ideas and 
the proper ways of working these out and practicing them.”40 
It was not until Ellis’s project the Hindustani Jazz Sextet (1965), and his jazz orchestra album 
Electric Bath (1967), that the use of Indian musical elements—such as tala, raga, matra, boles, and 
tihai—and Indian instruments—such as sitar, tabla, tamboura, and dholak—were successfully 
integrated into his compositions, according to Gary Fienberg’s dissertation on Ellis.41 Fienberg 
also mentions the use of two ragas in Ellis’s piece “Synthesis” and states how Ellis’s conceptual 
approach—in which the composer sought to compose music that was purely Indian—
ironically falls entirely into the bounds of Western musical concepts (or at most, a combination 
of elements of both).42  
The jazz orchestra album by Australian composer and saxophonist Jeremy Rose, Iron in the 
Blood: Music Inspired by Robert Hughes’ the Fatal Shore (2014), demonstrates crossover between 
musical genres including, jazz, Australian convict music, Greek folk music, and south Indian 
classical music (Carnatic). Additionally, in his doctoral thesis on the Sydney Jazz Scene, Rose 
provides a comprehensive investigation into what he considers the authenticity of the 
“Australian sound” through an intensive discussion of several Australian and American jazz 
writers and critics, among them the prominent Australian jazz scholars Bruce Johnson and 
John Whiteoak.43 In addition, Rose interviews multiple prominent Australian jazz performers 
and university lecturers such as saxophonist Sandy Evans, trumpet player Phillip Slater, and 
drummer Simon Barker, focusing on their assessments of the aesthetics of Australian jazz 
performance and improvisation as well as on their musical experiences within the Sydney jazz 
scene.   
In his thesis, Rose also discusses the jazz orchestra composition he wrote for his album The 
Fatal Shore. The composition narrates the story of Australian convicts—starting from 
imprisonment in labor camps to freedom—by using a musical interpretation of Australian’s 
convict songs combined with jazz harmonies, blues-oriented pitch bending, and modal jazz. 
Rose also integrates additional musical elements that he refers to as “non-Western material,”

such as the Mirkov čoček, a Greek folk melody, and Indian melas (traditional scales). Other 
compositional techniques mentioned in Rose’s compositional analysis chapter include the use 
of the harpsichord to depict the movement of convicts from Georgian England to Australian 
labor camps, the use of aleatoric methods, in which he gives the players a pitch collection or a 
tone row and lets them choose a sound from their own decisions, and the utilization of 
“number diamonds,” a technique developed by Greg Sheehan, an Australian composer. To 
apply Sheehan’s compositional technique, Rose created a number sequence in which the last 
number of a series is moved up one step, and backward in the series, to build new variations.44 
In addition, Rose also states in his research that the compositions in this album were partly 
influenced by Wynton Marsalis’s oratorio for jazz orchestra and vocalists Blood on the Fields 
(1997), which Rose suggests may have also been motivated by Robert Hughes’ book, The Fatal 
Shore.45 
2.3 A CASE STUDY OF CROSS-CULTURAL JAZZ PROJECTS IN ASIA 
 
“I’m trying to draw from my heritage and enrich the jazz tradition without changing it. I’m 
putting into jazz, not just taking out” said Japanese American jazz pianist and composer 
Toshiko Akiyoshi.46 In his essay on Akiyoshi, Kevin Fellezs provides her biography and 
explicitly illustrates her artistic opinions on her cross-cultural compositions. Beginning with a 
discussion of Akiyoshi’s original compositions, “Long Yellow Road” (1961), “Kogun” (1974), 
“Village” (1976), and “Deracinated Flower” (1977), Fellezs illustrates the initial processes 
evident in Akiyoshi’s works, in which she blends Japanese aesthetics with musical elements of 
jazz, such as Brazilian samba rhythms, swing, and Afro-Cuban rhythms. 
Fellezs’s essay then demonstrates Akiyoshi’s use of traditional Japanese instruments in her 
music between 1970 and 1980, including the tsuzumi (hand drum), shakuhachi (a bamboo 
recorder), hyōshigi (wood clap), and koto (a zither-type instrument). The author also provides 
insight into Akiyoshi’s personal perspectives on using traditional instruments in jazz orchestra 
music, with the composer explaining: “If you are infusing something into the music, a different 
element, it should become richer—that’s the important part. If you infuse an element and it

CHAPTER 2: Cross-cultural Perspective in Jazz: A Review of Related Literature 
 
 
24 
just remains something else, that’s not what I’m trying to do.”47 As a consequence, Akiyoshi 
began to use a flute to interpret the sound of the shakuhachi rather than employing the actual 
traditional instrument in her compositional processes; this musical adaptation was successfully 
performed in several instances by Lew Tabackin—the co-leader of a big band with Akiyoshi. 
Akiyoshi’s interpretation of other Japanese musical elements such as gagaku (imperial court 
music) and noh (a Japanese theatre tradition) can also be observed in “Kogun” and “Children 
of the Universe” (1992)—as noted in both Fellezs’s writing and Anthony Brown’s interview of 
Akiyoshi as part of the Smithsonian Jazz Oral History Program in 2008. In this interview, 
Akiyoshi also shares how she began to utilize trumpets to interpret the sound of gagaku 
performances—a process that required a distinct bending technique. Regarding the trumpet 
players’ first attempts to interpret the sound of gagaku, Akiyoshi noted, “[The] first time we 
rehearsed, the trumpet players were saying, ‘we can’t bend the notes.’ I said, ‘oh yes you can, 
because I’ve seen Japanese trumpet players do it, so if [the] Japanese can do it, you can do 
it’.”48  
David W. Stowe offers additional perspectives on Akiyoshi’s large-scale compositions. Two of 
her multi-movement suites, Minamata (1976) and Kourakan Suite (1992), witness the 
combination of utai (a specific noh musical technique) with the bebop language and collective 
improvisation.49 Interestingly, Stowe refers to Kourakan Suite as a demonstration of Japanese 
cultural pluralism. In this composition, Akiyoshi employed several musical elements that come 
from “non-Japanese traditions.” These musical elements include the adaptation of an Arabic 
melody during the introduction in 6/4 meter and the use of Tibetan instruments—specifically, 
the gsil snyan (a pair of large cymbals) and the dung chen (long metal trumpets)—which have been 
integrated with a shuffle feel and harmonies in a style reminiscent of Duke Ellington’s music. 
Akiyoshi also commented on the practice of pluralism within this composition, explaining, “we 
found out that migrations to Japan had come not only from Korea and China but also from 
far away, from the Near East, the silk roads… and this showed we have so many different 
people… not really Japanese, not really American, and not really Near Eastern.”50

Ethnomusicologists David Harnish and Jeremy Wallach discuss what they call “gamelan-
inspired jazz” in the music of Krakatau, a prominent cross-cultural jazz ensemble from West 
Java, Indonesia.51 In their article, the authors conduct comprehensive musical analyses of two 
of the ensemble’s pieces—“Pukul Pitu” and “Egrang Funk”—and describe the artistic and 
musical philosophies of Dwiki Dharmawa, the band’s leader, and Pra Gudidharama, one of the 
co-founders. In their musical analyses, the authors highlight the group’s hybrid musical 
processes, which include the deployment of local tunings for Western instruments to imitate 
the idioms of traditional Sundanese instruments, the use of bonang, a Javanese gong chime, to 
perform in particular musical contexts that are not synonymous with the instrument, and the 
application of improvisations by traditional instruments—such as the bonang, rebab, suling, and 
tarompet—over Western harmonic chord progressions.  
In terms of Krakatau’s artistic process, the authors highlight that Krakatau’s music, according 
to Dharmawan, is the result of “acculturation” (akulturasi) between musicians from two 
different backgrounds: those who studied Western music and those who studied karawitan 
gamelan (the science or intricacy of the gamelan). However, Dharmawan also explicitly states in 
Harnish and Wallach’s article that Krakatau does not perform “traditional music,” which may 
contribute to the restriction of certain performance techniques. Interestingly, Harnish and 
Wallach also point out how Krakatau’s contemporary approach sets the group apart from other 
gamelan jazz ensembles: 
Krakatau did fusion in reverse. While many of the American artists the Indonesian group emulates 
blended pop elements into their work to gain greater commercial appeal, the musicians of Krakatau have 
sacrificed popularity by incorporating more traditional music into their established pop-jazz sound.52 
 
2.4 A SURVEY OF CROSS-CULTURAL COMPOSITION STUDIES IN 
THAILAND 
 
Historical documents suggest that the initial cross-cultural blend of traditional Thai music and 
music from Europe most likely occurred after the appearance of Catholic missionaries in the 
sixteenth century during the Ayutthaya period (1350–1767). Nathinee Chucherdwatanasak

points to the work of Jittapim Yamprai, “Music in Roman Catholic Mass of Thailand,”53 which 
explains that early cross-cultural compositions in Thailand seem to have possibly contained a 
combination of reciting tones, similar to psalmodic plainchant, intermingled with the Thai 
vernacular. Pamala Moro also mentions the historical evidence of contact between European 
visitors—in particular, Portuguese envoys and French missionaries––and locals. 54  The most 
important musical evidence Moro presents is a travel document written in 1687 by French 
missionary Simon de la Loubere. In this document, de la Loubere describes the structure of a 
Thai two-headed drum shaped like a small barrel55 and mentions Thai vocal music. In addition, 
de la Loubere’s chronicle includes his attempt to transcribe what he calls a Siamese melody into 
Western notation. This transcription is possibly the first manuscript of Thai music notated by 
a Western explorer, and a portion of this melody ended up as one of several sources of the 
Thai royal anthem, which was composed in the late nineteenth century.56 
 
Jittapim Yamprai demonstrates the initial influences of cross-cultural hybrids between jazz and 
traditional Thai music—a widespread phenomenon due to the influence of Pradit Sukhum 
(1904–1967), a multi-instrumentalist who was credited with forming the first Thai-jazz 
ensemble during the 1930s.57 Yamprai’s research also refers to Eua Sunthornsana, a violinist, 
singer, and composer who was one of Pradit Sukhum’s pupils and a founder of the 
Suntaraporn Band, which would become one of the primary groups in the Thai urban music 
scene in the 1940s and 1950s, and would later disseminate a new type of cross-cultural 
collaboration in the form of a new musical genre known as Phleng Luk Krung (a type of Thai 
popular music that promoted the urban lifestyle).58 In addition, Sunthornsana also played a 
crucial role in establishing one of the prominent Thai cross-cultural ensembles with M.L. Krab 
Koonchorn and Pum Bapuyavat called the Snagkhet Samphan ensemble, whose utilization of 
the Thai Mahori ensemble (string ensemble) and traditional Thai repertoires was integrated into

58 Terry E. Miller has also described Phleng Luk Krung as a ‘city-people’ song, a type of song that uses both 
classical Thai and newly-composed melodies accompanied by Western instruments. See Terry E. Miller and Sean 
Williams, The Garland Handbook of  Southeast Asian Music (New York: Routledge, 2008), 180–181.

a big band setting.59 According to Kannaphon Yothinchatchawan, the Snagkhet Samphan 
ensemble used four different kinds of cross-cultural compositions: 1) vocal music with Thai 
classical music melody and lyrics, 2) instrumental music with Thai melody, 3) vocal music with 
Thai classical melody but new lyrics, and 4) new compositions inspired by Thai melodies.60 
Deborah Wong also points out that the musical influence of cross-cultural compositions in 
Thai music became increasingly prominent after the Siamese Revolution of 1932.61 She notes 
how the revolution initiated the Westernization of Thailand—known as the Thai Cultural 
Revolution—which lasted from 1938 to 1942, during the Phibulsongkhram regime. She also 
emphasizes that the decrees of the Cultural Revolution under Phibulsongkhram’s government 
had a dramatic effect on the Thai music scene. Performances of traditional Thai music tended 
to be overlooked, and the demand for Western ensembles to accompany Western dance styles 
increased significantly.62 As a result, cross-cultural musical compositions that adopted the 
characteristics of traditional Thai music and Western harmonies and rhythms—such as swing, 
foxtrots, and ballads—flourished and were disseminated to the Thai middle class; this music 
became widespread in many ballrooms in Bangkok. As mentioned earlier, one prominent 
musical ensemble was also Eua Sunthornsana’s band, Suntaraporn—the ensemble of the Thai 
Public Relations Department. Terry E. Miller also discusses a related Thai performance style 
called ramwong mattrathan63 which was a result of the Cultural Revolution. He describes ramwong 
mattrathan performance as “a circular social dance, using Thai-derived gestures of the hands, 
accompanied by Westernized Thai music.”64 
John Garzoli’s writings have also approached cross-cultural Thai compositional perspectives.65 
His 2014 article on Thai fusion music highlights the Thai artistic attitudes towards the degree 
of cross-cultural pollination—for example, Thai vs. Western perspectives—providing an 
extensive discussion of the Thai tuning system and its dissimilarity to equal temperament, and

examining a case study of several contemporary cross-cultural music ensembles, which Garzioli 
refers to as “fusion bands.”66 These bands include Tewan Novel Jazz, Boy Thai, Khun In Off 
Beat Siam, and Korphai, all of whom predominantly employ Thai instruments to play the 
melodic parts while using Western instruments to produce accompanying textures. For 
example, in the case of the Khun In Off Beat Siam ensemble, Garzoli illustrates the group’s 
adaptation of contemporary rhythms from styles such as rock and funk, as well as their use of 
functional Western music harmonies with the piano, guitar, and bass. They use these harmonies 
to accompany the Thai melodies—such as “Homrong Jin Dok Mai,” which is performed by 
the ranad ek (a Thai xylophone)—and Thai instrumental idioms, including the ti kep67 and rua68 
techniques in thang ranat and contribute to the distinctly Thai sound. 
Garzoli also discusses Fong Namm, one of the prominent cross-cultural ensembles in 
Thailand. He discusses the compositional and performance approaches of Bruce Gaston, a co-
founder of the group, and an American composer who studied with a highly respected 
traditional Thai musician and a national artist, Bunyong Ketkhong.69 Unlike other fusion bands 
from the same period, the compositional approaches of Fong Namm tend to follow the logical 
processes of Thai composition and performance. The group has referred to this approach as 
putting “Thai musical principles over Western [ones]” and the “Thai way of doing things rather 
than the Western [way].”70 As a consequence, the core music of Fong Namm has primarily 
comprised elements of Thai music surrounded by Western musical elements. Garzoli analyses 
three of Fong Namm’s compositions—“Ahnu,” “Chao Phraya Concerto,” and “Rabam Chao 
Rai”—highlighting their adaptation of Thai heterophonic music textures, Thai musical forms, 
the Thai classical music extended form called thao, and their imitation of Thai instrumental 
idioms by Western instruments—indicating the band’s ability to integrate their sound with the 
complexity of contemporary Western compositional approaches. 
Similar to the experimental compositional approaches employed by Bruce Gaston are the 
works of Thai composer, Jiradej Setabundhu. In his PhD dissertation, Setabundhu discusses 
his cross-cultural integration of contemporary Western classical compositional approaches into

Thai compositions.71 He provides a comprehensive commentary on four of his original 
compositions: “Thousand Lights,” “Façade,” “In Smoky Speculation,” and “Eine schöne Zeit 
war es.” Starting with “Thousand Lights,” Setabundhu describes a compositional process that 
he refers to as an adaptation of “Thai surface texture,” in which he constructs a Thai luk khong 
(principal melody), combining it with the Western compositional techniques of theme and 
variation. Thereafter, Setabundhu explains how in “Façade,” and “In Smoky Speculation,” he 
uses a musical form based on thao,72 in pieces written for Western instruments. Perhaps more 
interesting is how, in “Eine schöne Zeit war es,” he transforms the Thai sound in a non-
representational way. In this composition, Setabundhu structures the music on the concept of 
centonization—a hierarchical pitch system that he recognizes as a structural core of Thai 
music. He applies this system to a set of musical pitches that he personally interpreted from 
each word in a letter written by the painter Wassily Kandinsky to Arnold Schoenberg in 1993. 
Setabundhu took these pitches and constructed his composition through centonization, rather 
than through a framework such as Schoenberg’s serialism. About the compositional structure 
of “Eine schöne Zeit war es” Setabundhu remarked: “the piece does not sound similar to Thai 
music but is based on a very similar structural system.”73  
Two other key Thai composers who have successfully worked on cross-cultural compositions 
are Narongrit Dhamabutra and Narong Prangcharoen, both of whom are extensively discussed 
in Nathinee Chucherdwatanasak’s writing. Chucherdwatanasak describes the works of 
Dhamabutra as converting Thai sonority through Western instruments—as opposed to the 
exploration of complex Thai musical structures and experimentalism displayed in the music of 
Bruce Gaston or Jiradej Setabundhu. Chucherdwatanasak explains that the compositional 
approaches of Dhamabutra predominantly consist of using Thai pentatonic melodies, 
imitating the sound of Thai instruments, and employing compositional techniques from the 
Neo-Romantic period—which plays a crucial role in Dhamabutra’s compositional aspects. For 
example, in “Sinfonia Suvarnabhumi” (2005), Dhamabutra composed new thematic melodies 
inspired by the traditional music of Thai royal barge processions, transforming the sounds of

northern folk melodies and imitating the sound of the northeastern musical instrument pong 
lang (a log xylophone).74    
Narong Prangcharoen is another of the important Thai composers mentioned in 
Chucherdwatanasak’s study. Similar to the works of Dhamabutra, Prangcharoen’s cross-
cultural compositional projects predominantly focus on featuring Thai musical elements in 
orchestral pieces; however, the works of Prangcharoen focus more on incorporating harmonic 
dissonance and elements of atonality. Pawatchai Suwankangka provides a comprehensive 
discussion of Prangcharoen’s compositional process. For example, in Prangcharoen’s piece 
Three Minds, the three movements—“Fierce,” “Absent,” and “Hesitant”—were inspired by 
Prangcharoen’s Buddhism.75  In these three movements, the music is significantly influenced 
by idiomatic Thai instrumental techniques—namely, sabat (a set of three grace notes) and kro 
(two-pitch tremolo)—which were played by a ranad (a wooden xylophone).  
 
Unlike other cross-cultural Thai classical composers, Prangcharoen’s compositional aspects 
never fully adhere to the Thai musical tradition, with the composer preferring to take Thai 
musical elements and adapt them to his personal creative style. For example, in Prangcharoen’s 
interview with Bangkokbiznews.com, the composer provides an insight into his compositional 
perspective:  
 
Nowadays, I don’t think there is one hundred percent Thai [music], we are all affected by the concept 
of globalization, and we have been influenced by many different cultures around us… And, for me, the 
most important work on cross-cultural compositions is to find your own way to interpret Thai aspects 
in your music, and avoid following other composer’s footpaths.76 
 
Despite the abundance of contemporary studies on Thai cross-cultural projects, there remains 
a dearth of research on cross-cultural Thai jazz music, particularly from contemporary jazz 
perspectives. One explanation for this could be that the comprehensive jazz studies program 
is still relatively new, with the first jazz studies program in Thailand only being established in 
1998, as mentioned earlier. However, the demand for using jazz as a musical tool and infusing 
it with elements of Thai music has considerably increased, and the works of Thai cross-cultural 
contemporary jazz artists can be regularly experienced within the Thai music scene. These

recent projects of cross-cultural Thai jazz artists—e.g., the album Four Colors (2005) by Infinity, 
a Thai fusion jazz band; the Sunny Trio and Natt Buntita’a album Two of Kind (2016); and Pairat 
Lukchan’s album, Evening in Ayutthaya (2018)—witness the blending of Thai melodies and 
idiomatic singing techniques with contemporary jazz harmonies and rhythmic concepts in small 
ensembles. In addition, Saksri Vongtaradon’s composition “Long Nan” is inspired by the 
musical practices of a salo saw pin ensemble integrated with the melodic structures and 
harmonies utilized in contemporary jazz, and Sekpol Unsamara’s ensemble, the Sound of Siam, 
uses classical Thai instruments—including the saw u, khlui, and Thai percussion instruments 
such as the klong khaek, ching, and mong—alongside Western instruments in music similar to 
jazz-rock fusion and smooth jazz. 
 
2.5 AN OVERVIEW OF RELATED THAI MUSIC STUDIES 
 
Similar to the writings of David Morton, Panya Roongruang also analyses fundamental Thai 
musical elements, including Thai tuning and modes, tempo, meter, texture, idioms, and styles 
that are crucial from a compositional aspect.77 Roongruang explicitly describes how Thai 
classical musicians practice their music, recounts the history of how Thai classical musicians 
transferred teaching methods from oral to written transmission, and illustrates the changes—
and losses—in the Thai music repertoire by comparing multiple versions of Thai classical music 
manuscripts. Roongruang also illustrates how musicians can use Western notation to write Thai 
music, using examples such as meter adjustment, displaying the typical range of Thai 
instruments in staff notation, as well as using luk tok (target pitches) to indicate Thai melodic 
phrases. The author also highlights potential problems which may occur when using staff 
notation to notate Thai music. Importantly, Roongruang’s research has also provided an 
extensive overview of the Thai manuscript collection published by the Thai Music Manuscript 
Committee between 1936 and 1942, which include transcriptions in Western notation, useful 
for composers in jazz and other Western-notated traditions in the study of Thai music.78 
 
Anant Narkkong contributes a clarification of rhythmic concepts in Thai classical music, as 
well as a comprehensive discussion on how Thai classical percussion instruments are

performed.79 In this research, Anant describes nathap (a Thai rhythmic cycle) and chan (Thai 
ideal tempo) and provides an explanation of the Thai rhythmic patterns generated by taphon (a 
two-headed drum mounted horizontally) in several different styles of Thai classical music. The 
author then demonstrates proper methods for notating Thai rhythmic patterns in Western 
notation and offers the example of drum stroke patterns employed in Thai repertories, 
including discussions of pieces such as “Si Nuan” and “Khaek Borrathet.”  
 
Somnuek Saengarun also provides significant insight into how Thai classical musicians 
compose music. 80 In his thesis, Saengarun investigates the compositional methods of Lt. Col 
Sanoh Luangsuntorn, a prominent Thai classical musician. These compositional techniques, 
include—to name a few—the application of independent luk khong (fundamental melodic 
lines), the utilization of particular patterns of luk tok (target pitches) from existing compositions 
to create new compositions, the diminution and extension of original compositions to create 
new pieces, melodic variations and embellishments, the application of diminutions and 
extensions combined with melodic variations, the utilization of sustained Thai pitches (luk 
thao), and the adaptation of foreign music accents81 (e.g., Khmer, Lao, Mon, and Chinese 
accents) to create new Thai melodic lines. In addition, Saengarun cites examples from 
Luangsuntorn’s compositions that are written in the homrong style (overture)—for example, 
“Homrong Pat Maharat” and “Homrong Nawamin Maharaja”—which the author had 
transcribed into Western notation. 
 
Terry Miller’s contributions to Thai music studies also include analyses of transcultural musical 
processes and detailed descriptions of regional styles. In terms of transcultural music processes 
and practices of cultural diversity in Thai music, he discusses how Thai musicians have adapted 
and reproduced a Chinese fiddle instrument (erxian) and Chinese struck zither (yangqin) for use 
in Thai ensembles.82 He also demonstrates the influence of Chinese theater (Chaozhou opera)

Luangsuntorn, Naitional Artist,” Master’s thesis., Chulalongkorn Unversiry (2018). 
81 Roongruang also clarifies the adaptation of foreign music accents (samniang) explaining, “since the Thai people 
avoided isolating themselves but interacted with people from many cultures, including those of the Western world, 
musical acculturation has occurred through Thai history. Thai musicians borrowed musical ideas from many 
cultures, including their tunes, musical idioms, instrument, and vocal styles, as well as song text imitating the 
sounds of foreign languages, and either reacted them in a Thai version or created new exotic music based on those 
fresh ideas.” Roongruang, “Thai Classical Music Its Movement from Oral to Written Transmission,” 72.

on Thai theatrical performances, and describes one particular style of Thai composition—“Jin 
Rua”— inspired by the application of samniang jin (Chinese accent),83 a style of Thai-centric 
composition where elements of Chinese music familiar to most Thai are invoked, often 
through stereotype. Miller also makes an argument regarding the cultural diversity of Thailand, 
stating “what makes Thai culture unique is not its isolation but its absorption of elements from 
its innumerable contacts with foreign cultures over many centuries, almost none of which were 
forced.”84  
 
In his 1977 doctoral dissertation, Miller provides a general description of the cultural diversity 
of Thailand and its geographic neighbors, of which he remarks “…within this relatively small 
subcontinent dwell at least 151 separate ethnic groups speaking endless dialects…” and “[t]o 
assume that these borders define the limits of each culture would be erroneous.”85 He then 
extensively describes the musical practices of northeast Thailand from an ethnomusicologist’s 
perspective (i.e., through historical contexts, descriptions of instruments of northeast Thailand, 
and details of various musical genres). His dissertation illustrates the improvisation process of 
the use of five basic modes called lai used in performance on the kaen (usually Romanized as 
khaen)—a bamboo mouth organ—and then describes the various styles used in a northeastern 
form of song called mawlum (sometimes Romanized as mor lam, and, e.g., mawlum glawn, mawlum 
ruang, mawlum phi fah) and its application in performances. Similar to Morton’s study, this 
extensive research has been marked as one of the cornerstone studies of traditional Thai music 
of the northeastern region.86 
 
Thai ethnomusicologist Kumkom Pornprasit provides significant insight into the traditional 
musical practices of the northern part of Thailand.87 In this research, Pornprasit demonstrates 
commonly used performance practices (e.g., khap saw88 [ขับซอ], salo saw pin, and Lanna 
                                                        
83 Besides the Chinese accent, other musical influences, e.g., “lao” for Lao, “khmen” for Cambodian, “khaek” for 
Muslim, Malay, and Indian, “mawn” for Mon, “phama” for Bruma, “jawa” for Java, and “farang” for Western. Also,

86 Other essays by Miller that illustrate the musical practices of northeast Thailand—and which are crucial from 
a cross-cultural compositional perspective—also include the 1971 essay, “The Musical Traditions of Northeast 
Thailand,” the 2005 journal article, “From Country Hick to Rural Hip: A New Identity through Music for 
Northeast Thailand,” and two book chapters in The Garland Handbook of Southeast Asian Music (2008), on Thailand 
and Laos.

drumming), describes the collections of northern Thai melodies and their compositional 
repertoires, and extensively illustrates the instruments used in northern Thai music. The author 
also describes the practices of salo saw sueng ensembles (from northwest Thailand) and compares 
the latter to salo saw pin ensembles (from northeast Thailand, mainly in Nan province), as both 
utilize khap saw performances or perform it as instrumental music. Other important research 
focusing on the practice of salo saw sueng ensembles includes the works of Bussakorn 
Sumrongthong and Pakorn Rodchangphuen.89   
 
Similar to Pornprasit’s work, the research of Prapad Krupradub has contributed an overview 
of the fundamental musical elements of rong ngeng performances in southern Thailand.90 In this 
document, Krupradub illustrates the history of southern Thai Muslim communities and 
describes the process of cultural exchange through the south of the country’s trade routes. He 
also highlights the musical instruments employed in rong ngeng performances and discusses the 
stylistic differences between rong ngeng performances in southeastern and southwestern 
Thailand by analyzing three different rong ngeng ensembles from Pattani, Trang, and Satun 
provinces, respectively. In addition, Krupradub uses Western musical notation in his musical 
analysis of the rong ngeng repertoires from these three different regions.  
 
Kuan Tuanyok is a Thai national artist who wrote another important work on southern Thai 
music.91 In this book, the author describes the traditional southern music that is employed to 
accompany nora performances, with examples such as “Pat Cha” and “Choet Re Si.” Tuanyok 
also provides an overview of southern Thai instruments such as the pi nora (a reed instrument), 
mong (a set of two gong bells), and thap (a pair of hand percussion instruments), and emphasizes 
the important role of a thap player (referred to as nai thap in the southern Thai dialect), whose 
performance must interact with the movement of the nora dancers. Wirat Leangsomboon’s 
related work demonstrates the melodic structures of nora music, using Western notation to do 
so. 92 Here, Leangsomboon begins the musical analysis by demonstrating the scales, ranges, 
melodic movements, and ornamentation implemented in homrong music performed by ten

performances in southwest Thailand.93 The research of Wichai Mesri and Atipon Anukool’s 
writing have similarly provided a summary of the musical repertoire of rong ngeng performances 
in southeastern Thailand. 94 
 
In addition to the research mentioned above are some documents that provide examples— 
transcribed into Western musical notation—of the traditional music practiced in north and 
south Thailand, as well as sample recordings of traditional Thai music that I have found 
beneficial for my own cross-cultural jazz composition study. These works and records can be 
found at the Gerald P. Dyck Ethnomusicology Archive of Lanna Music at Chiang Mai Rajabhat 
University, and at “phleng Lanna,” the Northern Thai Information Center, Chiang Mai  
University (which has provided recordings of traditional northern Thai musical 
performances).95  
 
2.6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
 
Ever since jazz rapidly swept the globe a century ago, musicians and composers have combined 
various musical traditions with jazz, with examples all around the world. Jazz writers and critics 
have approached this phenomenon in a variety of ways with some, like Stuart Nicholson, 
referring to the movement as the globalization of jazz and the adaptation of jazz to local 
musical traditions to the ends of establishing artistic identities or suiting local audience 
experiences. Some European jazz musicians applied their own musical traditions and 
manipulated folk melodies to create their cross-cultural music composition. These crossover 
processes include examples such as the application of bulerías, a flamenco rhythm, into blues 
by Chano Domínguez; the Swedish-folk-inspired music of Swedish jazz musicians Lars Gullin 
and Jan Johansson; and the integration of jazz musical elements into the convict songs of 
European Australians of Jeremy Rose, an Australian jazz saxophonist, all of which can offer 
distinctive jazz composing methods.

The employment of traditional music instruments, combined with the instrumentation of jazz, 
can also be observed in the works of Don Ellis, Toshiko Akiyoshi, and Krakatau, where 
Hindustani, Japanese, and gamelan ensemble instruments, respectively, were used in jazz 
ensemble contexts. However, several artistic experiences, such as Miles Davis’s comments 
about the difficulty of using the trumpet to mimic flamenco singing, or Toshiko’s remark about 
her trumpet player who asserts it is impossible to replicate Japanese musical techniques on his 
instrument, highlight the difficulty of the process of cross-cultural music-making. Importantly, 
the conflict between conservative and progressive viewpoints in previous cross-cultural music 
projects can be seen in works of flamenco jazz and gamelan-inspired jazz. Rodriguez’s research 
and the comment of Indonesia’s Krakatau ensemble also suggest that rather than being 
concerned with traditional aspects, their compositional approach appears to be focused on 
creativity.  
 
Similarly, influences of crossovers between jazz and Thai traditional music had been present 
since the arrival of the Suntaraporn Band in the Thai music scene between the 1940s and the 
1950s. Later on, Eua Sunthornsana, the band leader of Suntaraporn, also played a significant 
role in the origin of the Snagkhet Samphan ensemble, one of the prominent cross-cultural 
music ensembles, in which the utilization of the Thai Mahori ensemble and traditional Thai 
repertoires mainly in Thai classical music was similarly integrated into a big band. John Garzoli 
presents the case of Thai fusion ensembles, which were somewhat associated with the musical 
elements of jazz. He discusses the example of Bruce Gaston, a cofounder of Fong Namm, and 
his compositional techniques, emphasized that Gastons’s approach was heavily influenced by 
the Thai way of thinking rather than the Western manner. 
Other cross-cultural works in Thai music can also be observed from a contemporary classical 
composer such as Jiradej Setabundhu, Narongrit Dhamabutra, and Narong Prangcharoen. The 
cross-cultural works of Setabundhu, and Prangcharoen tend to be infused with Thai elements 
in superimposed methods, whilst Dhamabutra’s approaches took concept of the Neo-
Romanticism infused with Thai music. Prangcharoen also himself remarked on the purity of 
Thai music, which he believed there is no one hundred percent Thainess anymore due to 
globalization’s effect.  
In conclusion, the selected literature, documents, and dissertations discussed from section 2.2 
to section 2.4 provide vital information for a cross-cultural jazz composer. They provide the

artistic experience of previous cross-cultural jazz composers, demonstrate possible or potential 
compositional methods that can be applied to cross-cultural works, and discuss the obstacles 
that they encountered while working in cross-cultural jazz composition. To provide concrete 
information on how Thai musical traditions function contribute to my transcription methods, 
I selected several Thai ethnomusicologists whose works I outlined in section 2.5. The 
perspectives and findings of these researchers on Thai musical traditions substantially inform 
my work, and I discuss them in further detail in Chapters 3-6 of this dissertation.

Identifying Musical  
Elements of dontri thai doem  
(Thai Classical Music) 
 
I believe that learning about “respect” would be beneficial to such composers. I don’t mean other things 
when I say respect; rather, respect yourself for how much Thai classical music you know before 
embarking on a cross-cultural project. So, once they’ve determined their level, they can select a 
reasonable degree of Thai classical music knowledge to incorporate into their music. This, in my opinion, 
has nothing to do with a high level of expertise in Thai classical music. Even if it’s something basic, if 
you can come up with innovative ways to adapt or apply such musical elements to your music, that’s 
great. That seems to be more appealing to me.96

3.1 INTRODUCTION 
This chapter focuses on musical elements of dontri thai doem, Thai classical music. I begin with 
a brief overview of the history of the various Siamese Kingdoms and their transformation into 
the present Thai state, in order to provide context for Thailand’s musical diversity. Then, I 
discuss Thai classical music from the perspective of a jazz composer, in light of the goals of 
this project. I first discuss the Thai pitch concept and several examples of Thai melodies 
utilized in compositions of a lyrical type. I then explore textures, rhythms, and meters common

present some of the diverse compositional strategies used by Thai composers, and consider 
how such aspects can be used in jazz compositions. In addition, I offer a brief overview of 
Thai sacred ceremonies, which play an essential role in Thai Classical music practices.  
  
3.2 COSMOPOLITAN MUSICAL CULTURES IN SIAMESE KINGDOMS (CA. 
1200–1767) 
 
SIAMESE KINGDOM 
When the Khmer Empire’s influence in mainland Southeast Asia began to decline in the 
thirteenth century, several kingdoms, some of which could be considered city-states, emerged 
in the north and center of present-day Thailand. These kingdoms, such as Sukhothai, Lavo, 
and Suphannaphum, all of which absorbed Mon-Khmer influence and began to mingle a 
“Tai”97 language to communicate. The kingdom of Ayutthaya arose in the mid-fourteenth 
century, centered on a city of the same name, and incorporating some of these kingdoms by 
military actions and royal intermarriages. Ayutthaya was often call “Siam”98 by outsiders, and 
existed between 1351 and 1769. It is considered the precursor to present-day Thailand, and its 
ethnic diversity reveals much about the diverse cultural practices of Thailand today, including 
musical ones. 
Created by a merging of the Suphannaphum and Sukhothai dynasties and absorbing the 
previous states under Mon-Khmer influence including Lavo,99 the cosmopolitan kingdom of 
Ayutthaya was an ethnically diverse city-state that was politically and religiously influenced by 
the ancient Mon-Khmer kingdoms. It also adopted the language, cultures, and aesthetics of the 
Tai speakers who lived in the north and northeast areas within the kingdom.100 The political 
reach of the Ayutthaya kingdom extended throughout of Southeast Asia, from the northeast 
in present-day Thailand (where its dominance reached Nakhon Ratchasima), to the north in 
Phitsanulok and Sukhothai, to the west in Dawei (ทวาย)(present-day Myanmar), and to the south 
                                                        
97 The Tai language, which is now known as the “Thai” language, is a member of the ‘Tai-Kadai” language family. 
It was also used alongside Khmer, Mon, and Sankrit in the past, all of which had a significant influence on the 
Thai language of today. Chris Baker and Pasuk Phongpaichit, A history of Thailand (Cambridge: Cambridge

in Nakhon Si Thammarat.101 The Ayutthaya Kingdom also encompassed multiple ethnic 
groups, including Mon, Khmer, Tai, Lao, Chinese, and Malay, among others who also settled 
and resettled within the kingdom both voluntarily and involuntarily.  
The substantial social and cultural diversity of Ayutthaya society was observed by foreigners 
from outside of mainland Southeast Asia—including Portuguese, Japanese, French, English, 
Italian, Dutch, Muslim, and Moor, especially during the reign of King Narai (1656–1688). The 
Chevalier de Chaumont, the French ambassador to the court of the Siamese Kingdom during 
this period, stated, “there is no city in the East where [are] seen more different nations than in 
the capital city of Siam, and where so many different tongues are spoken.”102 Chris Baker and 
Pasuk Phongpaichit describe the contextual factors that contributed to the cultural diversity of 
the Ayutthaya Kingdom and its cosmopolitan society, writing, 
[The] Portuguese first arrived as soldiers of fortune in the early sixteenth century, and their numbers 
swelled when the Portuguese community was expelled from Macassar in 1668. Over the years, the 
Portuguese intermarried with other Christians, particularly those from Japan and southern India. By the 
seventeenth century, the mestizo community numbered around five to six thousand, occupied in petty 
trading and service. A community of “Moors,” meaning “Turks, Persians, Golcondans, and those of 
Bengal,” had been present since the heyday of mercenaries in the early sixteenth century, and still 
supplied soldiers and guards throughout the seventeenth, while others worked as sailors, sugar palm 
growers, weavers, binders, and dyers. Persian trader-officials flocked to the city in the early Narai reign, 
and though the numbers dropped after the fall of Aqa Muhammed Astarabadi in the mid-1670s, some 
three to four thousand remained a decade later.103  
Anthropologist Pamala Moro discusses musical aspects in historical documentation of Thai 
music since the sixteenth century. She explicitly summarizes the substantial historical records 
of contact between the people of the Siamese Kingdom and Europeans during the dominance 
of Ayutthaya, and points out that the first arrival of Westerners is most likely to have been the 
group of Portuguese envoys led by Duarte Fernandez in 1516.104 After Fernandez’s voyage, the 
number of foreigners who visited Ayutthaya gradually increased—particularly in the numbers 
of French missionaries who aimed to convert the kingdom into a realm of Christianity during 
the eighteenth century. Moro also states that two of the fifty-nine extant sources written by 
these European travelers in the sixteenth century provide details and references of a musical 
nature.105

Sixteen of the documents from the seventeenth century and two documents from the 
eighteenth century also illustrate musical practices of the Siamese Kingdom. The most 
significant musical evidence from this period is perhaps a travelogue written by the French 
diplomat Simon de la Loubere in 1687. In addition to the illustration of the Thai drum (shaped 
like a small barrel) as previously described in Chapter 2, this document highlighted the use of 
a duple meter in Thai vocal music, and included the author’s transcription of a Siamese melody 
into Western notation, under the title A Siamese Song (Sai Samon).106 This transcription is 
credited as the first musical document of Thai music notated by a foreigner, and a portion of 
the song’s melody was included in the royal anthem that was created in the nineteenth 
century.107  
MUSICAL TRANSCULTURATION 
The social, cultural, and ethnic diversity in the Siamese Kingdom created an openness to 
foreign influences from the Siamese perspective. As a result, diverse philosophies, religious 
beliefs, technologies, and cultures were widely exchanged in this region. The non-
discriminatory musical practices of Siamese music were no exception—the use of foreign 
instruments by musicians in the Siamese Kingdom was particularly common. As Sujit 
Wongthes, a Thai journalist and well-known historian explains:  
The culture of using Bamboo to manufacture instruments is one of the common cultures that can be 
exchanged in the Southeast Asian mainland. For example, ‘khaen’, a traditional instrument of Laotian 
and northeastern Thailand was also employed for performances in Siamese Courts in the Ayutthaya 
period.108  
Other musical instruments that were introduced by foreigners and employed in Thai classical 
music ensembles also included the saw duang and saw u, both two-stringed bowed fiddles that 
were adopted from Chinese instruments. Terry Miller suggests that these traditional fiddles 
seem to have a deep relationship with the Chaozhou Chinese instrument called erxian which is 
typically employed in Cantonese music.109

The gong is another foreign music influence that was exchanged and subsequently adapted in 
Thai classical music, in this case, originating in Indonesia. According to David Morton, these 
musical instruments and the production of such instruments also transferred to the Siamese 
Kingdom, via the cultural influence of the Khmer Empire. Many twelfth- and thirteenth-
century illustrations of musicians and ritual ceremonies depict sets of kettle gongs that have a 
partly similar structure to the musical instruments of Siamese court music, which can also be 
seen at multiple archaeological sites in Angkor Wat and in Central Java.110 Thai historian Danit 
Yupho also states multiple percussion instruments used in Thai classical music such as the 
taphon (double-headed barrel-shaped drum) and rammana (frame drum) also came from India 
and other cultures in the Malay Peninsula, respectively.111   
While these traditional instruments explicitly originated abroad and remarkably influenced the 
traditional music practices of Siamese cultures, musicians in the Siamese Kingdom began to 
develop their own characteristics in order to suit the aesthetic tastes of its people, with 
musicians starting to create their own unique techniques—unrelated to the original cultures—
to perform on these instruments. As David Morton explains:  
The mainstream of Thai traditional music as it is known today is probably a composite of musical 
elements from several cultures. Thai music itself [consists of] influences from Chinese, Indian, and 
Khmer (Cambodian music). Musical elements from other neighboring cultures, Burma, and Malay, for 
example were possibly also absorbed into the evolving Thai traditional style. Characteristically the 
assimilated elements were incorporated in the existing culture of the Thai to suit their own taste, resulting 
in a culture distinct from those from which these elements were originally acquired.112 
Philip Cornwel-Smith has also proposed a critical process in Thai cultures that results in 
transformation and adaptation, arguing that absorbing foreign influences is unavoidable for 
Thai people. He states: 
 
Making imports Thai is actually an old tradition. While all nationalities absorb outside influences, Thai 
have retained their distinctiveness and independence despite living at a crossroads of cultures: Chinese, 
Indian, Western, Japanese, Khmer, Burmese, Malay, and indigenous tribes. The customization of 
imports is key to that elusive, immutable Thainess, since the essence lies not in invention, but 
transformation. Anything, given time enough to steep here, can end up very Thai.113   
The example of foreign musical instruments in Thai music provides an example of the broader 
concept of how Thainess develops out of cultural diversity, and helps explain why the people

of Thailand seek to adopt other musical cultures from which they create their own. Most 
significantly, the practice of transculturation in Thailand is a result of the great ethnic diversity 
and origins of the Siamese Kingdom in the past. It is also likely related to its location in the 
center of mainland Southeast Asia. As a result, this condition contributed significantly to 
previous cultural exchange activities.114  
THE MODERN THAI NATION 
After the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, the Siamese state was reestablished and declared 
independent by King Taksin (1767-1782), who was then followed by King Phutthayotfa (1782–
1809). King Phutthayotfa was the founder of the Chakri Dynasty (1782–present), which 
marked the beginning of the new era known as the Rattanakosin period (1782–1932). During 
this time, the Siamese court was relocated to Bangkok, and military actions largely pushed the 
migration of other ethnic groups into Siamese territory. Notable displacements in this period 
included the resettlement of Laos, Phu thai, Tai Dam, and Puan (พวน)—to name a few—all of 
which took place during King Rama III’s reign (1809-1824).115 These groups of people were 
forced to relocate from the east bank of the Mekong River to live in the area of present-day 
northeast Thailand, in towns such as Kalasin, Nong Khai, Nakhon Phanom, and Sankon 
Nakoh. This resettlement led to significant transculturation in northeast Thailand and 
contributed to the construction of traditional northeast Thai music, and to the broader diversity 
of traditional music in Thailand.   
It was also during the period of the Chakri Dynasty, during the reign of King Chulalongkorn 
(or King Rama V, as he was known by most Thai) (1868-1910), that the concept of “one 
nation” became firmly established and the ideology of nationalism began to be promoted.116 
One of the main factors in the introduction of such ideology was the immense influence of 
colonialism from Western countries on the Siamese court. During his reign King 
Chulalongkorn began to reform the procedures on how the court governed satellite states near, 
                                                        
114 Transculturation is a concept that introduced by Fernando Ortiz. James Lull, the author of Media, 
Communication, culture: A Global Approach. (2000), further explains that the concept of transculturation is a process 
whereby cultural forms literally move through time and space, where they interact with other cultural forms and 
settings, influence each other, produce new forms, and change the cultural setting.

116 “Those many countries which have been formed into nations and countries uphold that the history of one’s 
nation and country is an important matter to be known clearly and accurately through study and teaching. It is a 
discipline for evaluating ideas and actions as right or wrong, good or bad, as a means to inculcate love of one’s 
nation and land,” From the speech of King Chulalongkorn delivered in 1907, as quoted by Chris Baker and Pasuk

but outside the territory of the kingdom. These states, for example, Lanna in the north and 
Pattani in the south, were gradually forced to merge into Siamese territory and began to lose 
their autonomy to govern themselves. Similar to the northeast resettlement, the ethnicities and 
cultural practices of the people of Lanna and Pattani were widely diverse and dissimilar to the 
social and cultural practices of the Siamese court. This territorial annexation of the two regions 
also resulted in distinctive music traditions, which were later recognized as the traditional music 
of northern and southern Thailand.117   
Another important factor that reshaped the society, culture, and ultimately the borders of 
modern Thailand was the loss of territory of the Siamese Kingdom between 1785 and 1909. 
According to David Wyatt, seven incidents of the Siam territorial losses include:118 
1) Cession to Britain by the Sultan of Kedah, 1785-1909.  
2) Cambodian territory placed under French protection by Franco-Siamese Treaty, 1876. 
3) Black Tai territory taken by France, 1888. 
4) East Bank of Mekong ceded to France by Franco-Siamese Treaty, 1893. 
5) West Bank of Mekong ceded to France by Franco-Siamese Treaty, 1904. 
6) Western Cambodian provinces ceded to France by Franco-Siamese Treaty, 1907. 
7) Malay states ceded to Britain by Anglo-Siamese Treaty, 1909. 
After these losses, the border of the Siamese Kingdom took that shape of the borders of 
present-day Thailand. Following the Siamese revolution in 1932, the country’s name was 
changed under the government of Prime Minister Plaek Phibulsongkhram from Siam to 
Thailand in 1939.119  
These histories of ethnic diversity in what is now Thailand have profoundly shaped the 
prominent traditional music practices of the nation today. These practices can be generally 
divided geographically into four distinct regions:  
1) the musical practices of the center of Thailand or Thai classical music, which have 
been fundamentally influenced by Mon, Indian, Khmer, and Chinese traditions;

2) the traditional music of northeast Thailand, which predominately originated from 
the resettlement of Lao people;  
3) the musical practices of southern Thailand, which distinctly consists of the culture 
of Malay Muslims and Mahayana Buddhist beliefs; and  
4) the traditional music of northern Thailand, which was mainly influenced by northern 
Tai (Lanna), Lao, and Burmese cultures.  
I will spend the remainder of this chapter discussing Thai classical music from the perspective 
of a jazz composer. In Chapters 4, 5, and 6, I discuss musical traditions of the other three 
regions. 
3.3 THAI CLASSICAL MUSIC (DONTRI THAI DOEM) 
 
 
Unlike flamenco, tango, or Bulgarian folk music, canonical musical practices in Thai classical 
music—emerging from central Thailand, where this music was historically practiced by the 
Siamese court—are quite distinct from Western music practices. In particular, and of interest 
for this study, Thai classical music differs from Western music in its tuning systems and musical 
textures. When I began my research into Thai classical music for this jazz composition project, 
I sought to understand how the music works based on the perspectives of Thai musicians. 
Later on, I transferred what I acquired from Thai classical music into Western musical 
terminology in order to explain these findings in a manner that jazz composers can 
comprehend. 
 
PITCH AND THAI MELODIC PATTERNS 
 
The fundamental principles of pitch production in Thai music can be divided into two 
categories: 1) a system of seven distinct pitches within one octave produced by melodic 
percussion idiophones, namely, ranad 120 and khong wong 121; and 2) the musical pitches that are 
performed beyond the seven distinct pitches, and are generated by fretless bowed string 
                                                        
120 Ranad is a Thai musical instrument, that has a shape similar to a xylophone in Western music. The Ranad family 
includes four instruments: ranad ek, ranad thum, ranad ek hlek (ระนาดเอกเหล็ก) and ranad thum hlek. The ranad ek 
(predominated instrument) and ranad ek hlek (metallophone) can produce seven distinct sounds within three 
octaves. As for ranad thum and ranad thum lek (metallophone), it has a larger structure and is capable of producing 
a lower sound compared to ranad-ek (i.e. seven distinct pitches within two-octave).  
121 The Khong is a gong-type instrument used in Thai classical ensembles, with gongs arranged in a curve or circle; 
the three types consist of khong wong yai, khong wong lek, and khong mon, and are capable of producing seven pitches 
(without chromatic notes) within the range of two octaves. (Note: some of these pitches can go beyond two 
octaves, but are incapable of being completed within three octaves).

46 
instruments—namely the saw duang, saw u, and saw sam sai122—and by vocalists.123 In the first 
European conceptualizations of the tuning system in Thai classical music, it was believed that 
Thai tuning was produced by an ideal interval of 171.429 (seven equidistant pitches in an 
octave)—an idea initially introduced by the English musicologist and mathematician Alexander 
J. Ellis in 1885.124 However, this concept is considered to be controversial and impractical from 
the perspectives of multiple Thai music experts and ethnomusicologists. Among such 
dissenting opinions is one provided by John Garzoli, who writes that: 
 
The contention that Thai music is based on an equidistant tuning system should be abandoned because 
equidistance as specified by the accepted theory of Thai tuning (7-tet) does not exist in Thai music. 
Although Ellis’s theory of 7-tet prescribes an ideal interval of 171.429 cents, this is not found on actual 
instruments, and in the course of this study, no tuners endorsed nor adopted the theory in practice. The 
theoretical formulation incorrectly assumes an octave of 1:2, and the theory overlooks singers and string 
players. Unsurprisingly, given these conditions, the theory of equidistance has not been supported by 
empirical research, which has consistently found no evidence of it.125 
 
Even I myself began to experience uncertainty regarding Thai classical music pitches and 
encountered the dilemma of the 7-tet system when attempting to transcribe multiple Thai 
classical compositions. However, I have begun to accept and directly perceive that “intonation 
diversity” is the proper concept that should be applied to the tuning system in Thai classical 
music. In my transcription processes, I have found that every Thai classical ensemble has its 
own unique tuning system and employs diverse methods to blend their instrumental pitches 
when performing as an ensemble. However, nowadays, as the technology of Thai instrument 
construction has continually improved, Thai classical ensembles can now be constructed to 
produce a sound that is more mathematically “in tune” with regard to the Western tuning 
system.126 It is still important to me as a jazz composer (and others who may wish to approach 
Thai classical music) to understand and appreciate the concept of intonation diversity. This is 
important in collaboration with musicians of Thai classical music, because accounting for 
intonation diversity helps them preserve the sound of Thai classical music and foster their 
                                                        
122 A family of string instruments in Thai classical music, also known as khruang sai. Both Saw duang and saw u have 
two strings and tune in the perfect 5th from a Western musical perspective. The saw sam sai has three strings and 
can be tuned in the perfect 4th. These three fiddle instruments are fretless and performed in an upright posture.  
123 When tuning melodic percussion instruments, Thai musicians add or remove heated beeswax and heat particles 
(lead) under the wooden bars or gongs; for string instruments, players tighten or loosen their stings, in a similar 
manner to Western fiddles.

1-2. 
125 Ibid., 23 
126 When attempting to build Thai instruments that use the Western tuning system (A=440), Thai musicians refer 
to this system as sieng sakon (เสียงสากล). Ranad and khlui (a vertical block flute) are two of the instruments that are 
typically built adopting the Western tuning system. These two instruments are widely employed in cross-cultural 
ensembles such as Thai fusion bands.

expressive individuality (samniang), as well as the idiosyncratic characteristic of their ensembles 
called thang.127  
 
As previously stated, Thai idiophone instruments can produce seven distinct pitches, stretching 
out in one octave ideally. These seven different pitches appear to be dissimilar to the pitches 
of Western major scales, especially when comparing the intervals between the 3rd and 4th scale 
degrees and between the 7th scale degree and the octave, which is a half-step interval in a 
diatonic major scale, but much wider in typical Thai tunings. The other scale degrees produced 
by Thai instruments, however, including 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, can produce a sound relatively similar 
to the structure of major (or minor) pentatonic scales from a Western perspective. (Please note 
that Thai music compositions in the style of Mon called thang mon may employ the entire seven 
pitches when composing and performing.)128  
 
To make Thai classical music easier to transmit, Thai musicians developed several distinct 
systems of musical notation that can be applied to a set of these seven pitches. These systems 
include numerical or cipher pitch notation, which widely applies to string instruments (the set 
of a number refers to the fingering used for an instrument—for example, 1 refers to a lower-
pitched fingering, and 2, 3, 4 can direct the other successive fingers on that string129, as well as 
the Thai alphabetical system, which can be employed for various instruments in Thai classical 
music ensembles. The Thai alphabet system is widely used among Thai musicians, and these 
set of seven notes are called (ด), (ร), (ม), (ฟ), (ซ), (ล), (ท), respectively, and can be pronounced 
similarly to the syllables of the solfege system (do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si or ti) used in Western 
music.130 (It is important to remember that “do” or [ด] in Thai music is not equal to the “C” 
pitch [A=440] in Western music and rather closer to B♭). Nevertheless, this notation system 
can provide us with the pitch relationship of the melodic patterns, and we are thus able to 
                                                        
127 Please note that the word “thang” has multiple meanings, such as thang khrueang dontri (instrumental music style), 
thang nai (one of Thai classical music modes), thang lao (a musical accent), and thang krhu (the overall styles of a 
particular teacher and school).

129 The numerical system was officially introduced by Luang Pradit Pairoh (Son Silpabanleng), with Pamela Myer-
Moro providing further explicit statements from his daughter Khunying Chin Silpabanleng, who explained that 
“in those days (1913) music study was done by memory. Those who taught and those who studied wasted a lot 
of time. My father had to teach music over and over .... Then he thought of signs to help improve the memory

understand which musical notes can be interpreted as a tonic, subdominant, and dominant 
when analyzing Thai music from a jazz perspective. 
 
Based on these considerations of pitch for Thai instruments, as well as the comprehension that 
Thai instruments can produce pentatonic scales, I transcribed a number of Thai classical 
compositions, using tools of jazz analysis to identify the structures of their melodies with my 
compositional project in mind. Similar to transcription practices common in jazz, I started by 
transcribing several sections of Thai compositions that contain memorable melodic lines and 
less complex musical textures. These compositions, “Rabam Sukhothai,” “Soi Sang Dang,” 
“Lao Somdej,” and “Saen Kham Nung,” each of which contains textures featuring lyrical 
melodies, providing examples of a characteristic Thai sound, which I will explain later. These 
works are typically employed for entertainment purposes, in contrast to the irregular melody 
type used in Thai ceremonial music. 
 
Additionally, because of the intonation diversity of Thai music, the process of selecting 
particular recordings for this type of transcription is crucial. Most of the Thai ensembles whose 
recordings I chose for this study have tuning systems that allow them to be transcribed using 
an equal-tempered keyboard. For each composition, for example “Rabam Sukhothai” (Figure

melodic lines of the A and B sections performed by pi-nai (quadruple-reed aerophone), which 
constitute pitches that can be approximated to the key of G♭ major pentatonic. “Soi Sang 
Dang” (Figure 3.2)132 is from a traditional work famously performed in traditional Thai theater

In contrast to the major pentatonic melodies two previous pieces, “Lao Somdej” (Figure 3.3)133 
features an approximation of the B minor pentatonic scale. The melodic parts of the A section 
in this composition were transcribed from the instrumental parts of the sam sai from a live 
performance by the group of senior Thai musician teachers of Rattanakosin. The final 
composition I selected is “Saen Kham Nung” (Figure 3.4),134 a prominent Thai classical music 
piece composed by Luang Pradit Pairoh (Son Silpabanleng)—one of the most respected Thai 
musical masters. This music was transcribed from the sound of the ranad ek (xylophone-type 
idiophone), approximated in the key of B♭ major. After completing the transcriptions and 
analyzing them from a jazz perspective, I was able to identify some key characteristics of these 
types of lyrical Thai melodies, and compose melodic lines with these characteristics in my own 
jazz compositions.135  
 
Because each Thai musical ensemble has a unique approach derived from a combination of 
their music teacher’s instructions and their own individual artistic perspectives, these four 
renditions of Thai music compositions are just some of many possible ways of performing 
Thai music. However, the Thai classical musicians whose performances are transcribed for this 
project are among the most respected in Thai classical music, particularly the performance of 
“Lao Somdej” by HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn and a group of senior Thai music 
teachers, such as Uthai Kaewlaiad, Surang Duriyapan, Wichian Kerdphol, Chaloem 
Muangphresi, and Montri Tramote, whose teaching methods I shall discuss in further detail in 
this chapter. Even jazz composers must acknowledge that these groups of senior Thai 
musicians have had the greatest impact on classical Thai music education. In addition, I 
consider the performance of “Saen Kham Nung” by Asdavuth Sagarik, the great-grandson of 
Luang Pradit Pairoh (Sorn Silpabanleng) to be the most authentic rendition, given the direct 
relationship between the composer and the performer.

classical music theorist, labels this characteristic of Thai music as “penta-centric.”136 After 
applying scale degrees to my melodic analysis, I was able to generate a set of the particular 
melodic patterns that are repeatedly employed in these melodies. These patterns include (in

Inspired by these melodic patterns, I was able to reconstruct these characteristics in my own 
compositions, to reference these types of Thai lyrical compositions. For example, in my 
composition “A Siamese Medley,” I employed the use of several of the melodic patterns, which 
I had identified, including 1) 1 2 3 5, 2) 5 6 1 2 1 6, 3) 3 2 3 2 1 2, 4) 5 6 1 2 1 6, 5) 5 3 2 1 2 3, 
and 6) 1 6 5 3. I drew on these patterns and on syncopated rhythms, a key feature of jazz, 
before composing this piece partially based on rhythm changes, one of the more common 
expressions of AABA form in the jazz repertoire. These melodic patterns play a significant role 
in contributing a sound of Thai music in one of the standard forms used in jazz composition, 
performance, and improvisation (Figure 3.6).  
 
Other melodic patterns in a pentatonic scale—including 1 2 3 5, 1 2 3 5 3, 1 3 2 1 6¯, and in 
particular, 1 2 3 5 6—can also be widely observed in the set of melodic patterns called thang 
(roughly equivalent to modes in Thai music), of which three out of seven modes have a similar 
construction resembling pentatonic scales. 137 These modes consist of 1) thang phiang aw lang (G 
A B D E), which is mainly used in theatrical music (lakhon deuk damban)(ละครดึกดําบรรพ์); 2) thang 
phiang aw bon (C D E G A), which is often used in string ensembles; and 3) thang chawa (F G A 
C D), which is used in Thai ensembles when performing with an instrument called the pi chawa 
(quadruple-reed aerophone).138 Consequently, by understanding the use of the particular 
pentatonic scales and patterns implemented in Thai classical music, composers can incorporate 
characteristics of Thai melodies into a jazz composition, as I demonstrated in my preliminary 
composition, “A Siamese Medley.”139  
 
                                                        
137 Miller and Williams, The Garland Handbook of Southeast Asian Music, 142. 
138 These modes patterns were derived from Phichit Chaiseri, “A Thai musical analysis,” Due to the intonation 
diversity in Thai classical music ensembles, these patterns can be transposed to other keys, such as thang phiang 
aw lang (F G A C D) or thang phiang aw bon (B♭ C D F G). However, the patterns of these modes are still based 
on the 1-2-3-5-6 construction.

TEXTURE 
 
Musical texture is another significant element of Thai classical music to consider in projects of 
hybridization, particularly because of the absence of harmonic chord progressions (in contrast 
to Western Music). Numerous independent musical voices often constitute textures in Thai 
classical music, providing an abundance of simultaneous sounds that could be heard as 
harmony, from a Western perspective. Yet even to trained musician ears, it still can be 
challenging, in the context of some of these textures, to identify main melodic parts, 
contrapuntal lines, or overall rhythmic structures. While listening to Thai music—in particular, 
ceremonial music—the unfamiliar listener could be overwhelmed by the hierarchical 
complexity produced by the independent musical layers of the various instruments. One of the 
main reasons behind this confusion for those unfamiliar with the music is that in Thai classical 
music every instrument has its own separate function and distinct musical role when 
",162,1126
71," 
CHAPTER 3: Identifying Musical Elements of dontri thai doem 
 
 
55 
performing in an ensemble.140 The term in Thai music thang khrueang dontri (“style of 
instrumental music”) refers to the specific idiosyncratic function that each musician in an 
ensemble must carry out in order to interpret Thai compositions to suit the character of their 
instrument. In short, each musician performs the music based on the idiomatic way of playing 
his or her particular instrument.   
 
Much like jazz musicians who learn the skill of improvising over chord changes, musicians in 
Thai classical music construct their melodic lines based on the sound produced by the khong 
wong yai (gong circles), which creates the outline of melodic movements in Thai classical music. 
The khong wong yai usually begins with the fundamental music line called luk khong. Luk khong 
functions as the primary nuclear melody of Thai classical compositions that musicians must 
accurately learn and explicitly understand in terms of its movement. There are three different 
categories for patterns in luk khong lines: 1) restricted patterns, 2) semi-restricted patterns, and 
3) unrestricted patterns. These categories refer to the level of flexibility that the khong player is 
allowed to have—similar to varying levels of melodic embellishment a jazz musician might 
employ in performance.  
 
Another significant musical layer is thang ranad (style for keyboard percussion instruments), 
which is typically divided into two categories including thang ranad ek (style for higher-pitched 
keyboard percussion instruments) and thang ranad thum (style for lower-pitched keyboard 
percussion instruments). It is the thang ranad ek that may mislead unfamiliar ears to consider it 
as a fundamental melody when listening to Thai music, due to its characteristic sound being 
clear and rhythmically concrete. One of the musical techniques used to construct thang ranad ek 
is called plae thamnong (แปลทํานอง) (the performance methods for modifying main melodies to suit 
instrumental idioms), which can be related to structural idiomatic improvisation based on the 
luk khong principal melody. John Garzoli and Bussakorn Binson summarize this kind of 
improvisation as follows:  
 
As with jazz and other music involving improvisation, Thai improvisation is based on the principle of 
embellishing or transforming an underlying musical structure, in this case the nuea phleng [nuea means 
meat, phleng means song; nuea phleng is not heard in performance]. The primary function of this layer of 
musical structure is to act as a referent; the nuea phleng models the principles of musical organization 
inherent in the song which the performer then follows when creating melodic variations. In following 
                                                        
140 There are three different types of instrument ensembles that mainly appear in Thai classical music. These are 
the Piphat (a melodic percussion and reed instrument ensemble), Khruang Sai (a string ensemble), and Mahori, (a 
diverse ensemble comprised of melodic percussion, reed, and string instruments.) For more details, see: Yuhpho, 
Thai Musical instrument and Thai Musical ensemble, 79. 
",472,3226

CHAPTER 3: Identifying Musical Elements of dontri thai doem 
 
 
56 
the principles of melodic organization laid out in the nuea phleng, the improviser is expected to create 
thang [their melodic line, in the idiomatic style] that faithfully reproduces the referent’s melodic/rhythmic 
quality and maintains its structural and aesthetic cohesion.141 
 
To perform plae thamnong techniques, a ranad ek player manages to produce the individual 
musical line that simultaneously approaches the exact pitch of the luk tok (target pitch at the 
end of a melodic line)142, which is outlined by the khong wong yai and must coincide with the 
given beat provided in the “damped stroke accent” called chap. This is demonstrated in Figure 
3.7, where the pitches in the red circles identify the location of the luk tok, which is the note 
A.143 To utilize the plae thamnong technique, a ranad ek player must create melodic lines that land 
on the note A, synchronizing the line with the damped stroke called chap (+), examples of 
which are provided in three different approaches. Plae thamnong techniques can also be the 
product of pre-composed materials taught by a teacher, or of spontaneous improvisation by 
experienced players. According to Panya Roongruang, the aesthetic of plae thamnong techniques 
depends on how ranad players are able to render the sound of luk khong, writing that “the beauty 
of the thang of ranad’s variation is based on the performer [who] can bring together his/her 
memory of the luk-khong.”144 The use of plae thamnong techniques also plays a crucial role in 
contributing to the density of musical textures and the richness of rhythmic complexity in Thai 
music.

The distinct character of thang ranad thum can be interpreted as joyful and effervescent in a Thai 
musical sense. Because of its syncopated rhythmic feel and its musical embellishments deriving 
from luk khong—which a ranad thum player is allowed to employ—this musical interpretation 
helps such players to create a lively intervention into the Thai ensemble’s texture. From the 
point of view of jazz composition, the function of thang ranad thum could be explained as a 
counterpoint-maker, contributing interesting contrapuntal lines and more complexity to Thai 
music’s textures. Another plae thamnong technique that is prominent in Thai classical 
performances is thang pi nai, the style of pi nai, a predominant reed instrument in Thai 
ensembles. One of the main functions of pi nai in Thai ensembles is to intertwine with the 
sound of each of the other individual instruments. To do so, a pi nai player produces sustained 
pitches to close the empty space between various distinctive lines. In addition, the other two 
roles that seem to be important for a pi nai player, are 1) contributing to the musical expression, 
(e.g., joyful, sad, angry)145 and 2) create a musical interpretation of a so-called “foreign accent” 
                                                        
145 To express such musical emotions, the player may produce multiple staccato tones (tremolo), or play a fast 
passage in the short-range close to a target pitch, similar to a turn or mordent in Western music. Somnuek

known as samninag phasa.146 The performance of both thang ranad thum and thang pi nai in Thai 
classical music textures are displayed in Figure 3.8 (note that the luk tok which is A must 
coincide in all of the parts). 147

Similar to other ethnomusicological studies of non-Western music, whether the texture of Thai 
classical music is polyphonic or heterophonic is still debated among scholars. For example, 
Panya Roongraung has stated that “Thai music is linear and non-harmonic. Its texture is 
described as idiomatic heterophony in which each instrument plays its own specific idiom 
based on the same principal melody.”148 David Morton argues otherwise, writing:  
Not the relationship of one melody to an underlying progression of solid complexes of sound, as in 
Western harmonic music, but the relationship of one melody to specific variants of itself—one idea 
viewed simultaneously from several different viewpoints, multiplicity within unity—characterizes Thai 
ensemble music. The technique of combining simultaneously one main melody and its variants is often 
incorrectly described as heterophony; polyphonic stratification seems a more precise description, since 
each of the “layers” is not a close approximation of the main melody but has distinct characteristics and 
a style of its own.149  
                                                        
146 As previously discussed, Thai music originates from the transculturation of multiple musical cultures. 
Consequently, samninag phasa refers to different musical “accents” produced and interpreted by Thai musicians; 
samninag jin describes the musical accent from Chinese; samninag Lao describes the musical accent from Lao; and 
samninag mon refers to the musical accent of the Mon people.

59 
Perhaps the most suitable answer to the question of whether Thai classical music’s textures are 
heterophonic or polyphonic may be dependent on what types of compositions are being 
performed and by what types of ensembles. Terry Miller states: 
Piphat music of theater and ceremony tends to be motivic and the differences in idioms among the 
instruments rather great; but piphat music in sepha style tends to be more lyrical, with slighter differences 
among the instruments. The former is comparable to polyphonic stratification, and the latter is 
comparable to heterophony. Beyond that, Thai music exhibits passages that are nearly polyphonic, not 
the result of chance combinations but stemming from compositional processes. Broadly speaking, then, 
the texture of Thai classical ensemble music is heterophonic in that each musician realizes the preexisting 
melodic structure in the idiom peculiar to his or her instrument or voice.150 
The various textures of Thai classical music are crucial parts of my compositional approach in 
this project of music for jazz orchestra. I often use these textures in my work in conjunction 
with homophonic texture, which I will discuss in my analysis of my pieces in Chapter 7. 
RHYTHM AND METER  
Rhythm and meter are also significant elements of Thai classical music. Many Thai classical 
composers use a time signature of 2/4 due to the fact that the accented beat found in Thai 
classical music is typically located on the fourth beat (i.e., 1 2 3 4, or 1 & 2 & in eighth notes), 
rather than on the first beat as is common in Western music. This 2/4 concept was first 
introduced by the Fine Arts Department committee in 1929 in an attempt to preserve Thai 
classical music by using Western notation to transcribe the musical parts of the Thai 
ensemble.151 Even so, this 2/4 system still has not been met by a complete consensus among 
Thai classical musicians, though it is widely used in Thai classical music research—in particular 
in cross-cultural compositional aspects—and still remains the standard method for 
international musicians working in Thai music studies. Moreover, for my research, this method 
helps avoid confusion and provides articulate clear perspectives based on jazz composition 
 
In contrast to Western music, rhythm in Thai classical music seems to primarily function as a 
musical indicator rather than as a way of constructing sophisticated rhythmic variations or 
contributing stimulating pulses.152 There are two main forms of rhythm in Thai classical music 
employed by ensembles, namely 1) jangwa ching (rhythm defined by the ching, finger cymbals) 
                                                        
150 Miller and Williams, The Garland Handbook of Southeast Asian Music, 147. 
151 Narkkong, “Aspect of Improvisation in Thai Classical Drumming with special reference to the Taphon,” 72. 
152 In addition to ching, krab, mong, chab, taphon, thon, rammana, klong that, and klong khaek are all common percussion 
instruments in Thai classical music. 
",478,3112
76," 
CHAPTER 3: Identifying Musical Elements of dontri thai doem 
 
 
60 
and 2) jangwa nathap (patterns related to drums in the thon category of goblet-shaped drums).153 
In both forms, rhythmic patterns function as a musical gauge that must be synchronized to the 
melodic structures during performances, and play a crucial role when composing Thai classical 
music. To generate the sound of jangwa ching, musicians produce two distinct sounds from a 
ching instrument: the undamped stroke called ching and the damped stoke, termed chap. These 
two strokes are continually performed in various patterns to create cyclical rhythms and are 
typically heard in Thai music. Exceptions to this include instances when the ching player plays 
only the ching or chap sound, moments when tremolo techniques are used, or passages where 
the ching asymmetrically switches between those two sounds, depending on the type of 
composition.  
 
Ching patterns can be divided into two categories: 1) jangwa ching saman, consisting of 
approximately different twelve patterns, and 2) jangwa ching phiset, which consists of at least six 
patterns used to accompany different characters two forms of Thai theater, khon154 and lakhon 
chatri.155 Patterns from both categories are often performed in Thai classical music, but I will 
illustrate only three patterns from jangwa ching saman, namely, the chan dio, song chan, and sam chan 
patterns—all of which have influenced my work as a jazz composer. Indeed, one must be able 
to understand the concept of jangwa ching saman in order to generate musical ideas on how Thai 
melodic movements function with instruments providing rhythmic accompaniment. 
 
The concept chan in the names of the three patterns of jangwa ching saman refers to the ideal 
tempos that ching performers must indicate in an ensemble. For example, chan dio refers to a 
fast tempo, song chan, a medium tempo (which is widely practiced in the ancient Thai music 
repertoire), and sam chan, a slow tempo, which is used in extended musical forms in Thai music 
compositions known as Thao—which were originally created during the early Rattanakosin 
period and initially invented by Pra Pradit Pairoh (Mee Duriyangkul).156  
 
                                                        
153 I exclude “jangwa saman,” which is not related to a cyclical rhythm concept, but refers to the typical ideas of 
human rhythmic pulse and general tempo, e.g., fast, medium, slow. 
154 The masked drama is based on the Thai version of the Indian ancient epic, Ramayana.  
155 One of Thailand’s oldest surviving forms of dance-drama, with significant ties to nora, a traditional Southern 
Thai performance. See Chapter 5.

To indicate the pattern of jangwa ching in sam chan, song chan, and chan dio, the players indicate 
precisely the sound of the ching and chap, which are equal to a half note in eight measures for 
sam chan (fast, or third level), a quarter note in four measures for song chan (medium tempo, or 
second level), and to an eighth note within two measures for chan dio (slow tempo, or first level) 
when writing in Western musical notation (Figure 3.9). As Figure 3.9 illustrates, the pattern of 
ching song chan and ching chan dio starts on the pickup measure due to the accented beat of Thai 
music, as mentioned above. 
 
 
Figure 3.9: Jangwa ching patterns. 
 
The second concept, jangwa nathap, is notable in Thai classical music composition due to its 
cyclical form. In jangwa nathap, the two distinctly Thai rhythmic patterns nathap propkai and 
nathap song mai157 can provide useful means of understanding the framing of melodic phrases of 
Thai music, which must be synchronized and relatively restricted into each nathap cycle.  
 
To produce such nathap patterns, musicians perform them on two-headed percussion 
instruments, such as double-head barrel drums taphon or klong khaek, or on the pair of single-
headed drums thon and rammana. The syllables thang, thing, ja, and jo are used to describe four 
different types of sounds that constitute nathap patterns. Terry Miller has clearly demonstrated 
                                                        
157 There is another nathap pattern used in Thai classical music which is known as nathap phiset, consisting of nathap 
phleng, naphat phleng prasa, and more. Nathap phleng naphat in particular is mandatory for ritual ceremonies to pay 
respect and worship to Lord Buddha, Hindu gods and goddesses, and the great spirit of Thai classical masters. 
Therefore, such a musical genre must require deep respect, and special concentration which is may not suitable 
for composing in a cross-cultural jazz context due to the issue of cultural appropriation, from my perspective.

how to construct the sound of Thai nathap from klong khaek (the “wife drum” refers to the 
lower-pitch drum, and the “husband drum” refers to the higher-pitch drum), thon (the wife), 
and rammana (the husband): 
 
Thang: an undamped stroke on the center of the wife drum’s head with closed right-
hand fingers.  
Ting: the same as the preceding stroke, but on the husband drum’s head.  
Ja: an undamped stroke on the wife drum’s rim by two or three left-hand fingers.  
Jo: the same as the preceding stroke, but on the husband drum’s rim.158 
 
When bringing these four musical vocabularies together into single a rhythmic context, Thai 
percussionists are capable of constructing various cyclical rhythms: of nathap propkai sam chan, 
which consists of eight-bar phrases; of song chan, which consists of four measures; and of propkai 
chan dio, which can be performed in a two-bar rhythmic pattern (Figure 3.10).

After completing one round of nathap cyclic patterns, the complete cycle is called neung jangwa; 
when these nathap patterns rotate in approximately eight or twelve jangwa (rounds), it produces 
the thon—which is a larger unit in Thai musical structure. This larger unit of structure could be 
compared with the concept of a “chorus” in jazz, where a cycle of a particular duration and 
harmonic progression repeats. When two, three, or four thons (choruses) are combined, they 
form a complete movement, called a chan. Analyzing a chan as if each thon were a chorus, from 
a jazz perspective, can provide insight into commonalities shared among jazz and Thai classical 
music. In addition, the rhythmic pattern of nathap probkhai is also known to be employed in 
Thai compositions that contain less syncopation of the melodic line, and more predictable 
rhythmic phases.159  
 
Nathap song mai is a nathap pattern commonly used in shorter pieces which typically feature 
syncopated melodic lines and uneven melodic phrases. Nathap song mai is also characterized by 
the thang, thin, jo, and ja sounds, just like nathap probkhai when performing klong khaek. In 
comparison with nathap probkhai, the duration of nathap song mai is half as long, with four 
measures for sam chan, two measures for song chan, and a one-bar pattern in chan dio. Nathap song 
mai can also be widely found in the style called samninag lao (the “Lao accent” style of Thai 
classical music), in compositions such as “Lao Duang Duen,” “Lao Siangtian,” and “Lao Kham 
Hom.” Lastly, it is also important to note that when performing these two nathap patterns, Thai 
percussionists also allow the addition of certain rhythmic embellishments called sai (ส่าย), and 
the addition of a small rhythmic fragment called len mai.160  These musical techniques can help 
the rhythmic features of Thai classical music to become more unexpected. Figure 3.11 
demonstrates the rhythmic patterns of nathap song mai in sam chan, song chan, and chan dio. 
 
                                                        
159 Additional examples of Thai classical compositions with this pattern include “Khmen Sai Yok,” “Ratri Pradab 
Dao,” “Sarathi,” “Cho Ra Khe Hang Yao,” and “Iyaresi.”

Figure 3.11: Nathap song mai.  
 
Inspired by the individual character of Thai rhythmic patterns and endeavoring to apply their 
concepts to a crossover music project, I began to experimentally apply these musical elements 
for my own jazz composition practice. One way I did this was in composing rhythmic 
accompaniments in the drum set, as demonstrated in Figure 3.12. In this example, I constructed 
rhythmic accompaniment patterns on the snare drum and high tom in a 7/4 meter, common 
in contemporary jazz. This rhythmic pattern was based on the patterns of nathap propkai sam 
chan in mm.1-4, which was written in half-time on the snare drum.  
 
Figure 3.12: The adaption of nathap propkai sam chan to the drum set. 
 
I also applied nathap song mai chan dio to the electric bass as well, incorporating it with hip-hop 
and contemporary jazz harmonies (Figure 3.13).

In addition, I adapted nathap song mai song chan for the full woodwind and brass sections of a 
modern jazz orchestra, to be played in homophonic rhythm during an improvised drum solo 
(Figure 3.14). This provides a prominent musical character of Thai classical music rhythms and 
emphasizes the integration of musical elements of Thai music into this particular example of 
jazz orchestra music.

To apply these Thai cyclical patterns in a more conceptually interesting way, I also employed 
another musical technique of modern jazz orchestral composition: rhythmic displacement. One 
example of this technique is in a piano part I composed, inspired by the rhythm of nathap 
propkai chan dio (Figure 3.15). This type of piano pattern also could be accompanied by a drum 
solo or contributed to a concluding section of a piece to create a strong and solid ending for a 
jazz composition.

COMPOSITIONAL TECHNIQUES  
 
The original conceptualization of compositional methods in Thai classical music was 
embedded in the direct relationship between teachers and pupils. In a form of oral tradition, 
Thai composers would formally transfer the musical knowledge of traditional pieces or create 
new variations and personal adaptions out of traditional music and later teach them to pupils. 
But, from a traditional perspective, this process was intended to help Thai composers to 
preserve the characteristic sound of traditional music, and to maintain the traditional practices 
and values passed down through several generations of masters.161 
 
Like all living traditions, Thai classical music compositional approaches have adapted as the 
world has modernized, and these approaches have become more comprehensive and

complicated. In Thai classical music composition today, compositional concepts can be 
typically divided into three categories: bangkhap thang (fully composed, required to be performed 
in the exact version of the composer), mai bangkhap thang (composed only in terms of the main 
structure and allowing performers to apply improvisation techniques called plae thamnong), and 
keung bangkahp thang-mai bangkhap thang (กึ#งบังคับทาง-ไม่บังคับทาง)(partly performed according to the 
composer’s exact version and partly allowing performers to improvise).162  
 
The well-known traditional composition method developed by Pra Pradit Pairoh (Mee 
Duriyangkul) entails the creation of a new composition by applying melodic and rhythmic 
augmentations as well as diminution techniques to an existing composition’s melodic lines. 
These melodies and rhythms are based in song chan (second level), then extend to sam chan (third 
level), and again from song chan to reduce chan dio (first level), and then the three levels are 
combined together to produce one extended composition, called thao,163 which consists of three 
movements. (It can also be referred to as a suite from the perspective of jazz composition.)  
 
In the composition “Khaek Toi Moh” by Montri Tramote, a prominent Thai composer, and 
respected teacher, Montri employs the compositional technique of Pra Pradit Pairoh. He takes 
a melodic version of the traditional piece “Khaek Toi Moh” in song chan (which is widely 
performed in Thai dramatic dance), and then extends it to the thao compositional type (Figure 
3.16).164 
                    
                                                        
162  Personal interview with Somnuek Saengarun on July 27, 2020. 
163 In addition, Thao is also famous for lyrical music in which Thai composers display an expressive and emotional 
use of bot seapa (Thai poems) from Thai literature, and perform by alternating between instrumental and lyrical 
sections. 
164 The full score of “Khaek Toi Moh” can be found in Montri Tramote, Thai Music Manuscript Vol.1, 155-157.

Figure 3.16: Melodic and rhythmic augmentation and diminution techniques in 
“Khaek Toi Moh.” The red circles designate luk tok (target pitches) whose rhythm is 
derived from song chan. 
 
The “target pitches” (luk tok, circled in red) of each melodic line of “Khaek Toi Moh” play a 
crucial role in these melodic augmentation and diminution techniques. The phrase structures 
of the composition are also significant: they double from eight measures in song chan to sixteen 
measures in sam chan, while target pitches are equally divided across four measures in chao dio. 
These target notes may be necessary elements for accommodating Thai classical music 
composers’ formulation of new compositions. Composers of Thai classical music also employ 
the sounds of approach notes according to their aesthetic choices, with Montri mentioning that 
 
For the core concept of the augmentation and diminution in Thai compositions, indeed the most 
important part is to construct the pitches that [are] mandatorily based on the sound of “luk tok” in the 
original compositions, but for the melodic movements that [are] construct[ed] in the middle of each

69 
section and function as approach notes, to compose such melodic movements belong[s] to the 
composer’s decision, and it can express how genuine [of a] composer they are. Because they must use 
their musicianship and artistic inspirations to construct musical melodic lines, most of the good 
composers construct the sound that glides smoothly and gently [to] connect each story together, similar 
to the construction of Thai poems.165 
 
Besides the augmentation and diminution compositional techniques applied in thao 
composition, Thai composers also construct new extended musical compositions by 
combining old musical pieces (e.g., in a suite). Examples of this practice include 1) phleng ruang, 
an instrumental suite consisting of several traditional Thai compositions with a common 
theme, 2) phleng homrong, an instrumental suite mainly employed to open the performance—
similar to an overture in Western music—and often performed in religious ceremonies and 
theatrical performances, and 3) phleng tap (เพลงตับ), an lyrical suite which is divided into two 
categories—tab ruang, which concentrates on the meaning of lyrics that can be combined 
together in the related context, and tap phleng, which focuses on the similar sound of certain 
melodic lines rather than composition lyrics. In contrast to phleng thao, phleng ruang, and phleng 
homrong, phleng tap applies no augmentation and diminution of the melodic parts of certain 
traditional pieces, but may be constructed by selecting repertoires in various tempos. For 
example, phleng ruang ching phra chan klang wan (เพลงเรื.องฉิ.งพระฉันกลางวัน) is composed of the 
combination of traditional pieces in different tempos, and consists of selected pieces in song 
chan (second level) and chan dio (first level).166 
 
Another compositional technique widely utilized in Thai classical music, and related to jazz 
composition, is melodic variation. According to Uthit Naksawat, this melodic variation 
approach, known as thang plien (ทางเปลี.ยน), is often used in works to develop new musical 
concepts and evoke sensations of surprise in listeners.167 To implement this technique, Thai 
composers still strictly follow the rule of retaining the original pitches located in strong beats 
from the original melody (luk khong), and recreate the melodic lines (e.g., Figure 3.17).168

In addition to these three compositional techniques, Thai composers frequently create 
additional sections to their modified compositions. One of these techniques is to create a 
unique cadence for concluding sections called luk mot. A luk mot is a recognizable melodic line 
that operates similarly to concluding riffs in a blues. By including a luk mot to conclude a jazz 
composition, it can help Thai audiences to identify when a piece is ending in a particularly Thai 
way. The utilization of luk mot in Thai compositions is employed in two different ways: 1) 
constructing a luk mot that has melodic lines, or 2) implementing a luk mot that contains no 
melodic lines (approach lines) that correlate to the composition. Most important from a 
traditional perspective is that the ending pitch of luk mot patterns must finish in luk long yod, 
which is relatively equal to the pitch D in Western music.169  It is also noticeable that the 
implementation of luk mot sound must be related to the samniang (musical accents) of selected 
compositions (e.g., luk mot samniang, Kheak, Lao, Mon, Burma, and so on). An example of a luk 
mot appears in Figure 3.18.170

In another Thai compositional technique similar to luk mot, Thai composers may create 
additional sections called luk yon (ลูกโยน), usually in the context of nathap song mai or luk tao when 
constructing nathap propkai. Luk yon works similarly to a musical bridge or a pedal point in jazz 
composition. The application of luk yon and luk tao must be sustained by one recurring target 
pitch, and can be located at the beginning of a song or the beginning of separate sections, as 
demonstrated in Figure 3.19.171  
 
 
Figure 3.19: Luk yon, with target pitches circled in red.  
 
Wa dok, (ว่าดอก) as explained by my interviewee Somnuek Saengarun, is another compositional 
style that is widely used to construct additional sections, particularly in a type of Thai classical 
music known as phleng la (a farewell song). This compositional approach is to formulate a short 
instrumental solo between sections of vocal performance (wa dok). These solos are usually 
played by the pi nai, to give a musical interpretation of grief and to express nostalgic emotions 
as the solo interacts with the vocals. An example of a composition that includes wa dok is “Tao

Kin Phak Bung,” a piece usually played as the final part of a Thai musical performance (Figure 
3.20). 172 
Figure 3.20: Wa Dok section of “Tao Kin Phak Bung.”  
 
Interestingly, Thai composers also use instrumental techniques and melodic embellishments 
that are similar to those common in Western music. These approaches help express the 
character of an ensemble, and include 1) tremolo (thang kro), 2) a broken fragment of a melody 
(luk lo), 3) call and response (luk kut)173, 4) the melodic displacement of rhythm (luk leuam) 
(ลูกเหลื.อม), and 5) a combination of various instrumental techniques mainly used in solo 
composition (thang khap luk khap dok)(ทางคาบลูกคาบดอก). For example, Thai composers widely 
employ the tremolo technique (thang kro) to create positive musical sensations (e.g., 
pleasantness and sweetness), in particular during the introduction to a piece (Figure 3.21).

Breaking up a fragment of a melody and providing the resultant distinct components for 
performance by different instruments (luk lo) (ลูกล้อ) can also be observed in Thai compositional 
methods. Thai instruments such as the ranad ek and saw duang can function as lead instruments 
                                                        
172 This example was obtained from Thai Music Manuscript Vol.3 by Lekiat Mahawinitmontri and Lasit Issarangkun

173 Thai composers regularly combine luk lo and luk kut together. The term “luk lo luk kut” refers to a mixture of 
these two compositional techniques.

that perform the first phrase of the melody part and are then followed by the second 
instrument, which consists of the ranad thum and saw u, which perform the remaining melody 
section to create the sense of musical interaction (Figure 3.22).

Luk kut is another common compositional technique in Thai classical music. Similar to luk lo, 
luk kut functions by dividing instruments into two categories, in which a lead instrument 
performs a first melodic line, and the second instrument delivers the following melodic phrase. 
In contrast to luk lo, the melodic patterns of luk kut perform the opposite melodic direction to 
the first melodic lines, but are still based on the same rhythmic idea of the first pattern. In 
addition, luk kut can be understood as a call and response, like in early jazz, where two musical 
phrases are performed in the relevant context but are not necessarily exact in musical pitch 
(Figure 3.23).

Another technique, luk leuam (ลูกเหลื.อม), helps Thai composers generate interesting and complex 
musical ideas that can be implemented in accordance with Thai musical textures. As mentioned 
earlier, Thai classical music prioritizes featuring each instrument’s individual character. The 
purpose of the luk leuam technique is to highlight the character of a secondary instrument 
referred to as ranad thum, which has a playful role in Thai classical music and performs the 
primary melodic patterns of composition one beat ahead while being followed by the usual 
lead instrument, a ranad ek (Figure 3.24).175  
 
 
Figure 3.24: Luk leuam technique in “Kluen Kratob Fung.” 
 
One last compositional method of Thai classical music relevant to jazz composition is referred 
to as thang khap luk khap dok (ทางคาบลูกคาบดอก). This technique helps composers balance the 
compositional materials in Thai music. To apply thang khap luk khap dok, which is widely utilized 
in solo composition (phleng dio), Thai composers shift between instrumental ornaments—for 
example, between single melodic pitch tremolo (rua), and thang kep (an instrumental technique 
using a set of eight notes, mainly in an octave similar to plae thamnong techniques). This method 
can create irregular musical textures that musically produce more complicated rhythmic ideas 
and sophisticated melodic patterns. Thang khap luk khap dok also helps musicians of Thai 
classical music to pay tribute to the mastery of the teachers who have taught them how to 
practically utilize and musically organize such materials in the composition. Besides thang khap 
luk khap dok, other techniques that appear in Thai compositional methods include the use of a 
set of three grace notes (sabat, sadot) for melodic embellishment sections, or the implementation 
of continuous sixteenth notes in idiomatic improvisation to create an intensity in texture known 
as khayi (ขยี%).

3.3 PRELIMINARY COMPOSITIONS 
 
Based on what I have learned about these compositional methods in Thai music, I have applied 
elements of them to processes of jazz composition. One example of this is my arrangement of 
“Giant Steps” by John Coltrane, which uses the augmentation and diminution techniques 
employed in thao compositions (Figure 3.25). As can be seen, in the B section, I expand “Giant 
Steps” from its original 4/4 to a 5/4 time signature, which is inspired by thao compositional 
approaches. Subsequently, I reduce the time signature of this section from 5/4 to 4/4, then to 
3/4, in the way Thai composers generate thao compositions, which begin with sam chan, song 
chan, and chan dio. To provide add more complexity, in the C section, I additionally displace 
these three different time signatures to give the illusion of irregular meters.176

A second example is my original composition “Nanapa,”177 where I apply several Thai classical 
compositional techniques to create a contemporary jazz composition (Figure 3.26). The 
introduction of this composition (A section), begins with thang kro (tremolo), widely found in 
the introduction sections of Thai classical music pieces. This is followed by the C section, 
whose use of luk yon (sustained pitches) contributes the sound of pedal points to the music 
before moving to the thematic melody section in the D section. In the E section, I divide the 
melody parts for use in a call and response context and provided this particular melodic line in 
two separate sections that can be interpreted as being in luk lo (5/4 section) and luk kut (6/4 
section). Lastly, I employ melodic variation (thang plien) in the F section, and include the ending 
cadence pattern luk mot, to support the composition and give it the character of Thai music. 
For this luk mot, I partially incorporate the cadence pattern for the luk mot used in Khaek Toi 
Moh.

3.4 SACRED CEREMONIES 
 
As I have shown, applying the perspectives of Western musical analysis can assist in 
understanding elements of Thai classical music that may be relevant to hybrid-style approaches 
to jazz composition. Understanding the sacred and spiritual doctrine of Thai people’s belief is 
also an important element of understanding Thai classical music. Before performing Thai 
music, Thai musicians usually hold their hands together tightly with the sticks of their 
instruments and then bring them above their heads, which their minds follow by contemplating 
their deities, teachers, and parents to appreciate the spiritual moments and musical knowledge 
that they have received, and also to pay respect to the instrumental spirits that they believe are 
symbolically embodied by Thai musical instruments. 
 
The hierarchy of Thai music compositions used in sacred ceremonies can also be observed in 
three different types of pieces, namely, 1) phleng khru (respected pieces) 2) phleng saksit (sacred 
pieces which must be respected), and 3) phleng suung (เพลงสูง) (restricted pieces which must be 
highly respected).178 All such music types may also be located in the phleng naphat category, 
which explicitly contains inconstant melodic lines, free rhythmic approaches, and asymmetrical 
measures,179 and which generate opposite perceptions to the lyrical music types demonstrated 
earlier. To learn such music, Thai musicians must strictly acquire knowledge from their 
teachers, who will carefully provide the musical knowledge of phleng naphat according to a 
student’s level of musicianship. Typical names of compositions in phleng naphat include 
“Saathukarn”—a musical piece of worship of the three gems of Buddhism; “Tra Homrong,” 
“Tra Choen,”(ตระเชิญ) “Tra Sannitbat”—musical pieces used for the deities’ invitation;180 “Rua 
Sam La”—a particular composition that invokes the act of the deities’ salutation and 
demonstration of their powers; “Choet”(เชิด)—a musical composition of the processional

journey to human realms; “Klom”—a musical piece for the arrival of the deities and all the 
divine music master sprits; “Kraao Nai” (กราวใน)—a piece anticipating the invitation of the 
highest god and the most Sacred demon deity; and “La”(ลา) —a composition played to indicate 
that all deities and spirits are assembled.181 
 
In Wong’s book, Sounding the Center: History and Aesthetics in Thai Buddhist Performance, Montri 
Tramote explicitly categorizes the hierarchy of learning this musical tradition in five levels. 
Students progress through each level of the hierarchy as they develop their performance 
practices for sacred ceremonies (khrop kru). Tramote describes the five levels as follows. The 
first level is an initiation in which a student takes flowers, incense, a candle, and a designated 
amount of money to the teacher, who will later grasp the student’s hands and start to play the 
first piece of traditional Thai music called “Saathukarn” on a khong wong yai in the first 
ceremony. The second level proceeds only after the student has completely learned the evening 
overture (the standard ritual music repertoire). In the second ceremony, the teacher again 
grasps the student’s hands and plays the beginning of the ritual piece “Tra Homrong.” For the 
third level, the student begins to learn the daytime overture from the intermediate naphat 
repertoire, and at this level’s ceremony, the teacher will grasp the student’s hands and play a 
special piece, called “Tra Baungkarn” (ตระบองกัน).182 In the fourth level, the student must begin 
to study the complicated and high-level ritual pieces in the phleng naphat category. And, in the 
sacred ceremony at this level, the teacher will grasp the student’s hands and play 
“Basstaskuunii” (บาทสกุณี). For the highest level, the fifth level, the student begins to study the 
highest piece in the naphat category known as “Ong Phra Phiraap.” Before studying this piece, 
the student must be over thirty years old and have been ordained as a Buddhist monk (for male 
students).183 These five levels of sacred ceremonies play an important part in every Thai classical 
musician’s education and are of high concern to the traditional music practices in Thai classical 
music, of which any cross-cultural composers working on Thai classical music projects should 
be appropriately considerate and aware.

3.5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
 
Thailand’s musical diversity is a product of the country’s extensive history of social, cultural, 
and ethnic diversity. This notion has also resulted in Thai musicians being more open to foreign 
cultures, as evidenced by their use of foreign instruments and adoption of what they call foreign 
musical accents. For Thai classical music, each ensemble has its own unique way of tuning their 
instruments, which is referred to as “intonation diversity,” an important considering when 
undertaking a project of musical hybridization of Thai music with music for jazz orchestra.  
 
Despite that diversity, many Thai instruments produce pitches in, or close to, Western tuning, 
which can be transcribed in Western staff notation as approximations. Thai classical music, 
unlike Western music, contains no harmonic progression; instead, it is composed of multiple 
distinct lines in the style of thang khrueang dontri. Thai musical textures can relate to idiomatic 
heterophony or polyphonic stratification depending on the style of composition. Two concepts 
of Thai rhythm that are important are jangwa ching, and jangwa nathap, which function as a 
musical gauge for Thai classical musical performances. These two notions are also strongly 
connected to chan, which refers to the ideal tempos and is divided into three levels: sam chan, 
song chan, and chan dio.  Rhythmic patterns of nathap propkai and nathap song mai also appear to be 
used as accompaniments for drum, bass, and piano parts. 
 
When writing thao compositions, composers of Thai classical music use the concept of chan, in 
which old traditional music pieces were diminished and expanded to produce a new work. In 
addition, this technique can be combined with other jazz compositional approaches to generate 
an innovative method for jazz arranging, as demonstrated in my arrangement of “Giant Steps.” 
Other compositional approaches used in Thai classical music are comparable to those used in 
jazz, also include combining songs with similar melodic characters to create a suite (phleng ruang), 
or building extended sections, such as an introduction (luk yon) or an outro (luk mot). In 
addition, thang kro, luk leuam, luk lo, and luk kut all appear to be beneficial and provide distinct 
techniques effective in both arranging and composing for a small jazz ensemble, as evidenced 
in my preliminary work, “Nanapa.”

4.1 INTRODUCTION  
 
To provide background on dontri isan nuea (often shortened to isan nuea), this chapter begins 
with a brief overview of the musical cultures that constitute the traditional music of northeast 
Thailand. I then examine the performance methods and musical instruments of isan nuea.  
I also include transcriptions of a number of isan nuea performances, each of which has provided 
insight into my compositional work. Following that, I investigate the use of lai (modes in isan 
nuea), discuss these modes’ distinctive meanings, and demonstrate some of the musical overlaps 
between a particular lai, lai se, and common elements of jazz performance. In addition, I include 
my full transcription of “Lai Teay Khong” performed by Sombat Simlah, the khaen master

from Mahasarakham Province, to provide an in-depth example of an isan nuea performance. 
Through my preliminary works, I offer several compositional approaches for incorporating 
isan nuea melodies, such as “Lai Ka Ten Kon” and “Lai Nok Sai Bin Kham Thung,” into jazz 
compositions. To close the chapter, I briefly discuss a traditional isan nuea singing style called 
mawlum, drawing on work by both Terry E. Miller and Chaweewan Dumnern. 
 
THE TRADITIONAL MUSIC OF NORTHEAST THAILAND (DONTRI ISAN 
NUEA) 
 
According to Charoen Chaichonphairote,185 three prominent and distinct musical cultures that 
have been in practice in the northeast Thailand include: 1) the musical culture of the upper area 
of the region (isan neua), which consists of fourteen provinces, mainly influenced by Thai-Lao 
ethnic groups; 2) the musical practices of the lower area known as isan tai (อีสานใต้)(which refers 
to the south), consisting of three provinces, primarily influenced by Khmer music; and 3) the 
musical culture of the Thai-Khorat people located in Nakhon Ratchasima Province—which 
has partly influenced the music culture of central Thailand. I focus here on the music of the 
Thai-Lao upper area (isan nuea), and on the ways I have adapted this music in my hybridization 
processes as a composer. 
 
This particular style of music depicts the way of life of Thai-Lao communities who live in the 
wide plain area where the Mekong River is a symbol of the people’s lives and is crucial to their 
survival—particularly for the region’s agriculture, as the weather can be harsh and marked by 
extreme drought, especially during the summer, from late January to the middle of May. 
Consequently, the sound of music from isan nuea serves as the musical expression of its people, 
who sing and play instruments to heal their suffering in such hostile weather conditions—
communicating with local spirits186 for encouragement when they are sick (lum phi faa), 
entertaining themselves after finishing work in a paddy field, or providing music for their 
religious processions (hae)(แห่), such as hae bangfai (แห่บั%งไฟ), or hae phawet (แห่ผะเหวด). 
                                                        
185 Charoen Chaichonphairote is a prominent Thai ethnomusicologist specializing in the traditional music of 
northeast Thailand and has been teaching at Mahasarakham University—where the musical culture of 
northeastern Thailand is largely practiced. For more details on the historical musical knowledge of northeastern 
Thai music, please see Charoen Chaichonphairote’s book, The Traditional music of northeast Thailand, (Bangkok: 
Srinakharinwirot University press, 1983). 
186 Even though the musical practices of northeast Thailand seem to be less ceremonial when compared to Thai 
classical music, the practice of wai khru (paying respect to the teachers) and other ceremonial music used to praise 
local spirits—in particular for Phaya Tan (พญาแถน)—still can be observed in the region and its style.

4.2 PITCH AND INSTRUMENTS 
 
The traditional music of northeastern Thailand uses a set of seven diatonic pitches similar to 
those in Thai classical music, and its melodic structures are also predominantly based on a 
penta-centric concept. The original tuning systems of isan nuea music were developed from 
diverse methods in disparate provinces—a subject that needs more evidence-based research to 
prove various hypotheses on the original tuning practices in remote areas.187 However, 
nowadays, some instruments from this musical region have been widely produced by adapting 
the Western tuning system (A=440) as their standard, a process which is referred to as sieng 
sakon. These instruments can be performed with Western instruments, and their performances 
lend themselves to transcription in Western notation more efficiently than those of Thai 
classical music. One of the limitations that seems to occur with isan nuea musical instruments, 
from my perspective as a jazz composer, is that one instrument is only capable of playing in 
one key (e.g., khaen in Am, or wot in Dm), which may cause difficulty for isan nuea performers 
when employing key modulation. (Isan nuea musicians prefer to refer to the key of their musical 
instruments in the minor). To begin the discussion, I describe the use of isan nuea instruments 
and how they can function in a jazz composer’s setting. 
 
KHAEN 
 
A khaen is a bamboo mouth-organ used in northeast Thailand and Laos.188 When performing, 
the player covers the small holes that have been drilled in each small pipe, located on the left 
and right sides. The range of the instrument is the two-octave diatonic scale for a khaen paet 
(with sixteen pipes in total on the two sides), which is commonly employed in isan nuea music. 
Other instruments in the khaen family consist of 1) khaen hok, the smallest organ (six pipes in 
total, e.g., the khaen hok in G is capable of producing G, A, C, D, E, and G­ , 2) khaen jed 
(fourteen pipes in total—e.g., a khaen jed in Am—consisting of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A­,  B ­, 
C­, D,­ E,­, and F ­, i.e., less than two octaves), and 3) khaen kao, the biggest organ (with 
eighteen pipes in total, a khaen kao in Am is capable of producing A, B, C, D, E, G, A­,  B ­, 
                                                        
187 For more details on isan tuning system, see chapter Miller’s chapter, The Kaen Reed-Organ, its Description 
and History, “Kaen Playing and Mawlum Singing in Northeast Thailand,” (1977). 
188 Other bamboo mouth-organ-based instruments with different structures and names are also played in Vietnam 
and by ethnic minorities in South China. See, Sujit Wongthes, “Thai Music refers to the musical practice of center 
Thailand, other musical regions are excluded.” Matichon online  
< https://www.matichon.co.th/columnists/news_210907>, (13 July 2016).

C­, D,­ E,­, F ­, G­, A­­,  G­­, and C­­). Please note that multiple pipes on the same khaen 
may produce the same pitch.189  
 
The khaen paet (sixteen-pipe model) is the instrument that most frequently appears in isan nuea 
performances. It is also capable of performing as a solo instrument or accompanying a singer, 
also known as molam. Unlike the fingering of Western music mouth-organs, which are 
sequentially arranged from lower pitches to higher pitches, the fingerings used to play a khaen 
paet can be disorienting, but are effective for the pentatonic concepts and traditional melodies 
of isan nuea (Figure 4.1).190  
 
Figure 4.1: Khaen paet’s fingering. The right hand’s fingers move among the adjacent 
right-hand pipes (1–8), while the fingers of the left hand do the same for the left had 
pipes (9–16). 
 
Another striking characteristic produced by the khaen is a drone. Similar to Hindustani classical 
and Carnatic music in India, the use of sustained pitches—known as sieng sep (เสียงเสพ)—can be 
also observed in khaen performances. A set of such sustained pitches, consisting of the root, 
P4, P5, and octave notes which are explicitly heard in isan nuea music are produced when the 
khaen player consistently covers the holes corresponding with those pitches with their fingers. 
Alternatively, players fill such holes with adhesive substances called kitsoot 191 when performing 
to produce the same effect.   
 
The primary role of the khaen in isan nuea can also be observed as that of a lead instrument, 
with the instrument providing a tuning pitch for ensembles, and musical adjustments of 
dynamics, articulations, and tempos when performing in a group. One of the most important 
musical elements in isan nuea music is called lai. This term denotes the modes and melodic lines

of traditional compositions, and was also originally generated from khaen performance, with 
isan nuea musicians identifying the concept as lai mae bot (fundamental modes).192 Experienced 
or respected khaen players in communities are also appreciated as maw khaen, which is a title 
given to an honorable, skilled khaen master who plays a crucial role in the oral tradition of this 
musical style.  
 
PHIN 
 
The phin is a small fretted lute consisting of two, three, or four strings that can be performed 
as a solo instrument, or to accompany singers or other instruments in a musical ensemble 
context (often alongside the khaen). The tuning system of the phin is also fascinating, as it can 
be based on different provinces’ perspectives (and thus is quite diverse), and must be adjusted 
to the sound of a drone (similar to a khaen) in each composition. For example, Chulalongkorn 
University academics discovered the notion of the lai noi tuning system, which was founded in 
Nong Kai Province and is tuned to D-A-G193—in contrast to Terry Miller’s study on lai noi, 
from a different region where the instrument is tuned to A-D-A.194  
 
Based on my work with phin performers in 2016–2017 with the Faculty of Music, Silpakorn 
University, and similar to Apiruk Phoosanga’s research195, several standard tuning techniques 
are now commonly used in phin performances, in contrast to regional tuning methods. These 
systems are divided into three categories for a three-string phin: 1) E-A-E (the most widely-
used); 2) E-A-A; and 3) E-B-E. There are four tuning categories for a two-string phin: 1) E-A; 
2) E-B; 3) E-D; and 4) E-E. Finally, four varieties of a four-string phin: 1) E-A-E-A; 2) E-A-E-
B; 3) A-E-A-E; and 4) E-E-A-A. (Please note that the first letter refers to the first string—the 
lowest pitch—while the second refers to the second string, and so on). When playing the phin, 
isan nuea musicians also use a plectrum, or pick, that was originally made of buffalo or cow 
horns. Nowadays, the pick often comprises of any plastic products that are easily found in 
communities. Phin players even sometimes use modern guitar picks to pluck the instrument’s 
strings.

To practically understand how the phin can function, I transcribed two solo pieces, “Lai Ka 
Ten Kon (ลายกาเต้นก้อน)”196 (“crows dancing over the rocks”) by Thongsai Thabthanon—a phin 
master from Ubon Ratchathnai Province, (Figure 4.2) and “Lai Kaeo Na Ma (ลายแก้วหน้าม้า),”197 
(“a house’s face”) live-recorded by Boomma Kaowong (Figure 4.3), one of the most-respected 
traditional phin masters in isan nuea music from Kalasin Province. Thongsai Thabthanon’s 
stylistic performance is regarded as one of the forerunners of modern phin performance, using 
an electric phin (a phin with a pickup) in isan nuea ensembles. He is also known for being one of 
the prominent isan nuea musicians to record phleng luk thung (Thai folk songs) with a phin. His 
performances can also be heard in a number of isan nuea films, which I listened to several times 
before deciding to transcribe his performance. Boomma Kaowong, a visually impaired phin 
master, is acclaimed by isan musicians as the maestro of three-string phin and one of the most 
rhythmically skilled phin performers in isan performance. Additionally, he produced numerous 
modern isan nuea melodies still widely used in the phin repertoire.

Figure 4.3: “Lai Kaeo Na Ma.” Transcription by the author. 
 
As the transcriptions in Figures 4.2 and 4.3 demonstrate, phin performances are primarily based 
on the construction of pentatonic scales, which in these cases are D and G minor pentatonic 
scales. From a vertical compositional perspective, these two transcriptions also illustrate that 
the construction of phin performance can be built on both a single pitch and two pitches, which 
primarily build up from minor 3rd, P4, P5, minor 7th, and an octave; alternatively, the players 
play a set of three pitches, which usually build up from M2 and P4, and are equivalent to a 
suspended chord in jazz harmony. In my transcriptions of “Lai Kaeo Na Ma” I have included 
articulation marks to show various characteristics of phin performance. For example, a phin 
player may accent the upbeat in order to provide strength in a syncopated rhythm when the 
phin is being used to accompany traditional isan nuea dances. Interestingly, these rhythmic 
accents appear to be comparable to a swing feel, which is commonly stressed on upbeats while 
playing in eighth-note settings. Similar to khaen performance, both compositions use drones 
(sieng sep)—on the note D in the melodic patterns of “Lai Ka Ten Kon” and the note G in the 
“Lai Kaeo Na Ma” melody. Both are also based on the penta-centric concept. In addition, 
sixteenth notes are used in these two compositions to offer the performances a rhythmic 
intensity. 198 
 
PONG LANG  
 
Pong lang is a melodic percussion instrument (a wooden xylophone) employed in different types 
of ensembles in isan nuea music. It was originally designed in Kalasin province to be used as a 
signal indicator for annual events in communities, and to expel crows out of paddy fields. The 
                                                        
198 Appendix C.5-C.6 contains the MIDI files for figures 4.2 and 4.3.

CHAPTER 4:  Investigating the Musical Aspects of dontri isan nuea 
 
 
87 
pong lang originally consisted of six distinct wooden bars that produced five different sounds 
that related to a major pentatonic scale (e.g., G A C D E).199 Pleuang Chairasmee (1932 - 
2007),200 a national artist and a Kalasin native, expanded the range of the pong lang by adding 
extra wooden bars to the instrument, allowing it to produce six unique pitches, which became 
a common tuning system for the instrument.201 In addition, the tuning system of pong lang was 
modified to include the seven distinct pitches of the Western diatonic scale, allowing the 
instrument to participate in Western music ensembles. (Figure 4.4 illustrates three distinct pong 
lang tuning systems, consisting of traditional tuning, standard tuning, and seven-pitch diatonic 
tuning.)  
 
Figure 4.4: Pong lang tuning systems. 
 
Unlike Western xylophones, whose bars lay flat, the wooden bars of pong lang are tied together 
and hung on two vertical poles of differing heights, resulting in a profile similar to a right 
triangle. The pong lang can be played by either one or two players. When it is played by two 
players, the one person plays melodic patterns, and the other plays a set of drones. It is also 
used as a solo instrument or to accompany traditional dances, including seng phu thai (tribal 
dance) and dances called seng swing (fishing net), seng tum na (farming), and seng yae kai mod dang 
(เซิ%งแหย่ไข่มด)(hunting red ant eggs). Nowadays, pong lang instruments appear frequently in the

Thai media, as well as in ensembles of cross-cultural music of a Thai pop-rock type, in regional 
music scenes, called lum sing.202 
 
For an example of pong lang, I transcribed a performance of “Lai Ka Ten Kon,” which is also 
part of the typical repertoire for pong lang solo performance (Figure 4.5). The recording I used 
is by Lamut Sapphat, a renowned isan nuea musician from Kalasin Province.203  His reputation 
extended to other provinces, in particular Khon Kaen, where he taught isan nuea music 
performance at Khon Kaen University, one of the country’s most recognized music programs, 
which has made substantial contributions to isan nuea music research. I chose Lamut Sapphat’s 
performance of “Lai Ka Ten Kon” because of the relevance of several of the techniques 
utilized in this performance to the jazz composition and improvisation methods described 
below. 
 
In this performance, drones on the pitch A are heard throughout, and the entire melody is 
based on an A minor pentatonic scale. Similar to the performance on phin, upbeat accents are 
also heard throughout the performance. The pong lang player also provides accented staccato 
articulation on multiple downbeats to create a strong rhythmic sense, as in other types of dance 
composition of isan nuea. Interestingly, musical techniques that are similar to those of jazz 
composition and improvisation include: the use of a question and answer for constructing 
thematic melody parts (mm.3-8), melodic sequence (primarily built up from G-A-C-D in 
mm.14-22 and A-G-E-D in mm.23-27), and repetition (D-E-G) in mm.28-36 (indicated by the 
red arrows in Figure 4.5).204

KLONG HANG (LONG TAIL DRUMS) AND OTHER PERCUSSION 
 
The rhythm in isan nuea music is one of the notable musical characteristics. Because isan nuea 
instruments typically serve to accompany traditional dances, as a consequence, the rhythmic 
patterns in this particular music seem to be more aroused, excited, and more stimulated, in 
comparison with other regional musical practices in Thailand. The Thai word klong refers to 
membranophone instruments that uses to generate rhythm (jawang). And, for the isan nuea 
percussion category, it is klong hang or klong yao isan (a long tail drum), and ramana isan or klong 
teung (a medium-sized bass drum) that frequently appear in isan neua music. 
 
Klong hang produces three fundamental sounds: 1) Jo (the player uses the tip of their hand to 
make a treble sound); 2) Tung (the player applies the whole right hand to make a bass sound) 
and teung (same as the construction of tung sound but the player switches to a left hand); and 3) 
theng (the player either their left or right hand to make a bass sound out of the middle of the

106," 
CHAPTER 4:  Investigating the Musical Aspects of dontri isan nuea 
 
 
90 
drum). Theng is the only sound the klong hang is cable of making in ramana isan or klong teung, 
where it is performed together with kholaw (a Thai bamboo clave, using to emphasis the down 
beat). 
 
Various types of cymbals are used in isan nuea. The ching produces two sounds by damped and 
undamped stroke (the same as the one used in a Thai classical music ensemble). Chap lek is a 
pair of small cymbals, producing two distinct sounds (i.e., chae [แช่] and wap [วับ]), which are 
produced by the player slightly rubbing the cymbal surfaces against each other; when sliding 
the cymbals in the opposite direction to the player’s position, the sound of chae is produced, 
and when sliding the cymbals back toward the player’s position, the sound of wap is made. Chap 
yai is similar to chap lek, but twice the size, and capable of making two sounds, called chap 
(damped stoke), and chae (undamped stoke). 
 
4.3 MUSICAL ELEMENTS 
LAI 
 
Similar to thang in Thai classical music, the word lai is used in several ways in reference to 
significant elements of isan nuea.  It is being used in the names of traditional music pieces in 
isan nuea, especially ones that refer to nature and landscape, such as “Lai Ka Ten Kon,” (crows 
dance over rocks) and “Lai Maeng Phu Tom Dok” (bugs swarm flowers). It can also be the 
name of the sound of traditional isan nuea modes, such as lai yai, (equal to A minor pentatonic 
scale) or lai noi (equal to D minor pentatonic scale). In addition, lai is used in the names of 
repetitive melodic lines, used in processions, such as lai seng bang fai205 or lai klawng yao (long 
drum trail processions). Lastly, it is also used in the names of regional music accents, which 
include the names of geographical areas, such as “Lai Phu Thai Sakon Nakhon,” (the music of 
a phu thai tribe in Sakon Nakhon province) or “Lai Phu Thai Kalasin” (the music of a phu thai 
tribe in Kalasin province).  
 
I begin my discussion of lai in its meaning as the sound of modes, as this is the most important 
element of the concept to my process of hybridizing isan nuea with jazz composition. Then, I 
                                                        
205 The bang fai ceremony is also known as the rocket festival. It is one of the largest traditional events in northeast 
Thailand and Laos. It usually occurs from April to June. The purpose of this event is to beg for rain and the 
abundance of water before the farming season.

proceed to musical analysis of lai as traditional music compositions and describe how I adapt 
them to jazz compositions. 
 
For the lai system of modes, isan nuea musicians produce sets of six distinct sounds, using these 
sounds in their improvisation for solo performance, or to accompany traditional isan nuea 
singing, known as mawlum. Nowadays, the six modes typically heard in isan nuea performances 
are divided into two groups 1. lai thang yao (equal to the structure of minor pentatonic scales), 
and 2. lai thang san (major pentatonic scales) (Figure 4.6).  
lai thang yao 
 
1. lai yai, consisting of A, C, D, E, G (A minor pent.)  
  
 
2. lai noi, or lai long noi, consisting of D, F, G, A, C (D minor pent.) 
 
3. lai se, consisting of E, G, A, B, D (E minor pent.) 
 
 
lai thang san 
4. lai sutsanaen, consisting of C, D, E, G, A (C major pent.)  
 
5. lai pong sai, consisting of F, G, A, C, D (F major pent.) 
  
     
6. lai soi, consisting of G, A, B, D, E (G major pent.) 
  
 
Figure 4.6: Lai thang yao and lai thang san. 
 
As isan nuea is based on the inspiration of the environment, entertaining communities, and 
providing musical expression of people’s lives, the utilization of lai can help isan musicians 
express their musical feelings, such as pleasure (major tones) or sorrow (minor tones), and can

help them to avoid using unpleasant pitches, which they refer as sieng som206 (sour sound) while 
performing as solo instruments, or to accompany singers. The application of modes in isan nuea 
also plays a crucial role in the practice of an improvisation in thamnong yoi (an improvisational 
section) that isan nuea musicians apply to express their artistic stories through their instrument.  
 
As an example of how isan nuea musicians apply modes to the construction of melody and 
improvisational elements, I transcribed a live recording of a performance in lai se207 (E minor 
pentatonic scale) by the maw khaen Buahong Phajung, a khaen performer native to Udon Thani 
Province. According to the Khon Kaen University’s Isan Artists’ Archive, Buahong began to 
learn to play khaen from his father. He was also recognized in both Thailand and Laos and 
involved in the establishment of several philanthropic isan nuea music education organizations 
in provinces along the Thai-Lao border, including Nong Khai Province.208 I decided to 
transcribe his lai se performance, revealing the utilization of motivic development crucial to this 
khaen performance (Figure 4.7).209

One of the interesting aspects of this performance is how the maw khaen Buahong uses only 
one particular mode, lai se, to express the musical story and improvise on his instrument. The 
construction of this performance is primarily based on the E minor pentatonic scale, in which 
the intervallic patterns predominantly build up from E, such as, E-G, E-A, and E-B, and play 
an important role in generating melodic lines from a horizontal viewpoint. 
",97,616

CHAPTER 4:  Investigating the Musical Aspects of dontri isan nuea 
 
 
94 
To intertwine musical ideas together, Buahong also uses several sixteenth-note motifs, such as 
A-G-E, which can be observed in mm.9-11 and m. 23. In addition, he plays staccato quarter 
notes on beat one (in 2/4), which avoid the repetition of eighth notes frequently heard in the 
performance. Rhythmic accents on the first and second upbeats can also be examined in a 
variety of places. Importantly, the transcription of Buahong’s performance also reveals that 
chords generated by an E minor pentatonic scale, such as Gmaj, G6/9, Emin7, and Dsus4, are used 
in various places throughout the performance, providing homophonic texture to isan nuea 
music, as opposed to Thai classical musical texture, as described in Chapter 3. Other musical 
techniques such as motivic displacement and repetitions can be also examined in the 
transcription.210 
 
The most important concept from this transcription related to jazz composition is the way isan 
nuea musicians create and develop concise musical ideas that later connect to a big picture, a 
broader, cohesive story. Charoen Chaichonphairote also states that to produce an effective lai, 
isan musicians produce a short motive, or construct multiple intervallic patterns based on the 
individual notes from a particular lai (e.g., in lai yai [A minor pentatonic]).  
 
The player may start to construct the E note as the target pitch, and then move to A, followed by C, 
then to other pitches. Eventually, the player tries to circulate all pitches within the lai yai. Expert 
musicians can efficiently connect all the musical pitches and tell a story without providing interrupting 
moods that also known Thai words as “phuk klon (ผูกกลอน) [intertwined poem].211  
 
In developing practical methods for my musical hybridization project, I have adapted the 
application of lai yai (A minor pentatonic) to an open section of a bass solo I played, where I 
attempted to imitate the character sound of isan nuea music by 1) constructing the story from 
concise and repetitive motifs in a similar manner to the previous transcription, 2) applying 
drones related to khaen and phin performances, 3) employing related musical accents, on the 
downbeats of beat one, and the upbeats of beats two and four, and 4) adapting similar melodic 
patterns to those that I have transcribed (Figure 4.8).212 By including a bass solo section like 
this in jazz compositions, it can accommodate the sound character of isan nuea music, but 
produced by the timbre of Western instruments. This concept has many precedents in jazz,

Another meaning of lai significant to a cross-cultural music composition study is its use in the 
name of traditional compositions. “Lai Teay Khong,” “Lai Lom Phat Phrao” (wind blows 
coconut trees), “Lai Maeng Phu Tom Dok” (bugs swarm flowers), “Lai Nok Sai Nin Kham 
Thung” (birds flying over fields), are all names of compositions that contain fundamental 
melodic lines that a player must perform based on the original melodic structure, or making 
slight adjustments (melodic embellishments).214  
 
Isan nuea traditional melodies are relatively short in comparison to those of Thai classical music. 
The sound of these melodies is typically singable and memorable, as their origins may be 
associated with vocal music. When analyzing the standard performance of isan nuea music in

of isan nuea compositions may be diverse, due to influence by individual music teachers.

which such melody parts are typically located in the second section of a standard isan nuea 
performance, called thamnong lak, after the introduction section called thamnong kern (ทํานองเกริ.น) 
and followed by the improvisation section (based on the original composition themes), called 
thamnong yoi or don (ด้น). To better understand the standard structure of isan nuea performance, I 
decided to transcribe one of the most well-known lai (compositions) in isan nuea music 
repertoires, called “Lai Teay Khong,” performed by Sombat Simlah, the khaen master from 
Mahasarakham Province.215 Sombat Simlah’s rendition of “Lai Teay Kong” was chosen for 
transcription because I was impressed by his ability to generate improvisation that is both 
melodically and rhythmically challenging.  He is also an expert at developing complex intervallic 
patterns and thus able to convey a compelling musical story through his khaen performances. 
The transcription of his “Lai Teay Kong” is considered in detail below 
 
A KHAEN SOLO TRANSCRIPTION OF “LAI TEAY KHONG” PERFORMED 
BY SOMBAT SIMLAH 
 
Sombat Simlah begins his performance with 13 measures of quickly-moving rhythms, which I 
have labelled as section “A” (with Figure 4.8).216 It consists of his spontaneous improvisation 
in sets of sixteenth notes based on a B♭ minor pentatonic scale, primarily built up from F notes, 
eventually landing on the sound of a B♭ minor chord as a musical conclusion to this 
introduction section (thamnong kern).

highlight how Sombat Simlah developed the fundamental melodic patterns from his improvisation rather than to 
focus on harmonic rhythm components.

97 
Next, the original melody of “Lai Teay Klong” begins in a section I have labelled as “B” (Figure 
4.9). Sombat performs the melody section twice. The construction of Lai Teay Klong is also 
based on the structure of B♭ minor pentatonic scale which is divided into two sections 
consisting of melody A (m.14) and melody B (m.30), together in a section called thamnong lak. 
This section includes drones on B♭ and F, as well as staccato and accented ornaments. 
Interestingly, throughout this section, Sombat’s eighth-note rhythmic pattern is quite similar to 
a swing rhythm. 
 
 
Figure 4.10: The B section of “Lai Teay Khong.” Transcription by the author. 
 
In the C section, known as thamnong yoi, Sombat begins to generate the improvisation that is 
related to the theme of “Lai Teay Klong” (Figure 4.10). He uses a question-and-answer 
improvisational technique, which is divided into three sets, consisting of first (mm.46-49), 
second (mm.55-58), and third themes (mm.60-63). These improvised themes are all based on 
the construction of B♭ minor pentatonic scale built up from F, A♭ and B♭ from the horizontal 
aspect. In contrast to the improvisation methods in this section, the improvisational method 
in the D section adapts the melody parts of “Lai Teay Klong” (m.64). Here, Sombat attempts 
to deliver back the characteristic sound of the composition’s memorable melody. He also uses 
rhythmic variations so that the melodic lines can be performed differently than in their original

CHAPTER 4:  Investigating the Musical Aspects of dontri isan nuea 
 
 
98 
statement. Sombat includes many musical accents in his improvisation based on the melodic 
theme, as a result, the tempo slows down in contrast to the C section.  
 
Figure 4.11: The C and D sections of “Lai Teay Khong.” Transcription by the author. 
 
Moving to the E section, Sombat avoids a repetition of the fundamental melody and begins to 
develop improvisations by using intervallic patterns. These intervallic patterns of this section, 
primarily F-A♭, and F-B♭ are constructed on a B♭ minor pentatonic scale (mm.93-99), but with 
less rhythmic intensity compared to the C section (Figure 4.11). After this improvisation, and 
similar to the “head out” typical of performances of jazz standards, Sombat performs the main 
melody again at the conclusion of the performance. This begins in the G section (m.130) and 
continues to the H section (m.146), though the H section omits some parts of the melody A 
section of “Lai Teay Klong” to decrease the sense of repetition. It is notable that before this 
head out section, Sombat also implies the sound of the melody of “Lai Teay Klong” by using 
the embellishment of improvisational technique, established in the F section (mm.116- 122) to 
produce the fluid transformation from thamnong yoi (improvisation section) back to thamnong lak 
(melody section). This performance provides a useful example of a typical form in isan nuea

performance. To summarize, isan nuea musicians usually begin a solo introduction, then move 
to the melody part, and follow this by an improvisation section, before returning to the melody 
out section. (See Appendix A.4 for the full transcription of “Lai Teay Klong” performed by 
Sombat Simlah.)217

In combining the musical elements of jazz and isan nuea to produce a musical hybridity, I have 
developed distinct compositional and arrangement methods that can be divided into three 
categories. First, I have begun to experiment to harmonize the melody parts of isan nuea (retain 
the rhythm and the pitches of traditional melodies), by using jazz contemporary harmonies 
(e.g., using quartal harmony and chord extensions). Second, I have changed the melodic 
patterns of the traditional composition (e.g., modifying its rhythmic structure, and time 
signature, then applying the jazz harmonies). Third, I have either retained or adjusted melodic 
parts of traditional composition, expanding the form of jazz composition out of the standard 
context, and applied the idiomatic improvisation of isan nuea to create a musical hybridity 
expression And, because of the structural flexibility of pentatonic scales, typical of isan nuea 
melodies, consequently, I was able to re-harmonize isan nuea traditional melodies smoothly and 
practically by using modern jazz harmonies. These three initial compositional methods 
significantly provided me with a better understanding of blending isan nuea and jazz harmonies, 
which I also apply to my compositions for jazz orchestra. 
 
4.4 PRELIMINARY COMPOSITIONS 
 
My first adaptation of isan nuea music is a musical hybrid arrangement of “Lai Lom Phat Phrao” 
(Figure 4.13). I transcribed the melody parts of this piece from a video demonstration, provided 
by the Roi Et College of Dramatic Arts, Roi Et, Thailand.218 The melodic movement of this 
composition is based on an A minor pentatonic scale, which is melodically organized by the 
use of repetition of the first two pitches in each short phrase, which occurs in mm.1-9 and 
mm.19-29. This creates the memorable sound of this composition. In this arrangement, I 
created a harmony that primarily focuses on the use of extended chords. These chords, such 
as D9sus, Fmaj9, C6/9, G-11, and A-11 are employed to contribute modern jazz harmonies based on 
the melody of “Lai Lom Phat Phrao.” In addition, the harmonic rhythmic of this musical hybrid 
arrangement also utilized the use of modal interchange, with V-7 referred to as G-11 being 
used in a multiple of locations. I then decided to complete the arrangement of this song by 
adding the rhythmic feel of fast swing, which contributes musical hybridity that combines a 
sense of Thai melody with a jazz rhythmic feel.

Thung”219 to generate a more syncopated rhythmic feel (Figure 4.14) typical in jazz. Because of 
the repetition of beats one and three that frequently occur in isan nuea music, which can produce 
a sense of predictability, I decided to add anticipations so that the rhythms can appear on the 
upbeats of the second and fourth beats, providing a sense of syncopated rhythm, which is one 
of the robust musical elements and prominent characteristics of jazz. 
 
Inspired by “Magnolia Triangle,” by Ellis Marsalis Jr, and “Blue Rondo à la Turk” by Dave 
Brubeck, I arranged the original melody of “Lai Nok Sai Bin Kham Thung” which consists of 
a repetitive two-bar phrase, similar to the structure of the melody parts of “Magnolia Triangle” 
in a time signature of 5/4. This change significantly contributes to the rhythmic complexity of 
the arrangement, in contrast to the simplicity typically generated by the melodic movement of 
traditional music. To provide the musical elements of jazz for audiences, I decided to construct 
this musical hybridization to be improvised in the style of a blues. I use a jazz-blues standard 
form and its chord progressions, and later switch between dominant based-harmonies in 5/4 
rhythm influenced by “Blue Ronde a la Turk” (which also contains the integration of additive 
meters, traditional melodies, and blues improvisation). The modulation technique from the key 
A to B♭ pentatonic scales can be observed on the B♭7sus4/F chord to decrease the repetitions 
which may be produced by the two-measure phrase of the melody.220

Figure 4.14 “Lai Nok Sai Bin Kham Thung” arrangement, by the author. 
 
For the third composition in this initial compositional process, I sought to hybridize isan nuea 
music and jazz by 1) expanding its compositional form by creating additional sections for both 
the melodic parts and the improvisation parts, consisting of the sections of fast swing, Latin 
rhythms, free improvisation, and the rhythm of hip-hop, and 2) employing the idiomatic 
improvisation of isan neua using Western instruments, including upright bass and alto 
saxophone, to solo on lai yai and lai sutsanaen (ลายสุดสะแนน), as illustrated in my arrangement “Lai 
Teay Klong”(Figure 4.15). 
 
The A section of the open bass solo part requires the player to mimic the idiomatic sound of 
isan nuea improvisation in order to create the aesthetic of isan nuea based on its musical mode, 
lai yai. This is followed by the similarity of the open saxophone solo section, which is in a fast 
swing rhythm in the E Dorian mode (minor sound), producing the characteristic sound of 
modal jazz for listeners. The melody of “Lai Teay Klong,” one of the famous pieces in isan neua 
music, is performed twice in the D section without harmony and in the E section with the 
",215,1317
120," 
CHAPTER 4:  Investigating the Musical Aspects of dontri isan nuea 
 
 
104 
accompanying instruments. Its harmony in the E section is based on the chord progressions 
from “Countdown” by John Coltrane. My intent was to create a piece that contains one of the 
most memorable Thai melodic sounds and intermingle it with one of the well-known complex 
harmonies of jazz.   
 
When the solo player reaches the climax of the improvisation, performed in alternation 
between fast swing and Latin rhythm in the G and the F section, the arrangement transfers 
back to the sense of isan nuea character in which all melodic instrument players adapt the use 
of lai sutsanaen sounds to perform in free improvisation context.  The head out section of this 
arrangement, which is the I section, also provides the opportunity for the memorable melody 
of “Lai Teay Khong” to be heard again with the Countdown chord progression. Here, instead 
of fast swing, the rhythmic patterns performed emphasize the backbeat, with a laid-back feel, 
in a hip-hop style. Because of the diversity of rhythmic patterns and the remarkable character 
sound of this most famous composition in isan nuea music, I believe that this arrangement may 
significantly contribute to the practice of hybridizing disparate musical elements, as it 
implements both jazz and isan nuea elements that can be recognized by audiences of both Thai 
music and jazz.221

4.5 MAWLUM 
 
Mawlum, a traditional singing style, is another essential musical element of isan nuea music that 
I would like to illustrate. As mentioned earlier, the word maw in isan means ‘expert’ (n.), and 
lum means ‘sing’ (v.)222; consequently, the combination of mawlum points to an ‘expert singer’, 
or rather, the singing style in isan nuea music.223 The two main reasons why the mawlum style can 
significantly inspire aspects of jazz composition are the nostalgic sound of mawlum vocalists 
and their singing techniques, such as the application of blending pitches, fast and slow tremolo, 
pitch vibrations, and the beauty of the metaphors used and the concinnity of stanzas, which 
are implemented in the movement of the lyrics.   
 
The construction of mawlum lyrics derives from ancient pieces of literature, poems, and 
textbooks—in particular, nithan chadok (the Jataka Tales)224; alternatively, lyrics can be artistically

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-dFemBfGmU&feature=youtu.be> (2 October 2020). 
223 Terry E. Miller has further explained that mawlum refers to Maw (which means a “skilled person” as in mawyah 
doctor), doo (doo: to see fortune teller), or maw-kuam (kuam: lawyer). Singing has also been called lum kaen in 
reference to the organ which accompanies the singing. In central Thailand, especially during the nineteenth and 
early twentieth centuries, lum isan was known as aeow lao. Terry E. Miller and Charoen Chaichonphairote, “The 
Musical Traditions of Northeast Thailand,” Journal of the Siam Society (1979).

CHAPTER 4:  Investigating the Musical Aspects of dontri isan nuea 
 
 
106 
written by mawlum performers who necessarily utilize poetic metaphors to construct their 
rhymes and lyrical melodies, which must fit together with the sound of the accompanying 
instrument (khaen). In general, the messages of mawlum lyrics may refer to the teachings of 
Buddha (to encourage and provide morality to people’s lives), unexpected grief and tragic 
stories (to warn and urge the listeners), or playful attitudes (for entertainment about the 
romances, courtships, or personal life experiences of mawlum performers). The lyrical 
improvisation technique known as don klon (ด้นกลอน) also can be deployed while performing; as 
a consequence, skillful mawlum are capable of performing complicated narratives containing 
excellent rhymes, synchronizing the musical tones with the melodic lines and harmonies 
created by the khaen. To formulate practical examples of mawlum lyrics that can be applied in a 
mawlum performance to jazz composers, I would like to demonstrate two examples of such 
lyrics and their approximate pronunciation, as well as the translation of their meaning into 
English, which I obtained from Terry Miller’s study.225  
  
Sound in English: 
took tee nah        nawng net nuang lai 
ben bang took     sawat baman mee mua  
kum huk ton       tu tang tua la tao

Meaning in English:  
Everyone’s tears are flowing  
For it is a time of great sorrow.  
Love floods the mother's heart;  
She feels so sad that she would like to die. 
 
The categories of mawlum are also diverse, as the style evolved through oral tradition in different 
provinces of northeast Thailand. To accurately demonstrate this diversity, I have selected the 
illustrations contributed by Chaweewan Dumnern, who is an expert in mawlum performance 
and one of the most respected mawlum singers in northeast Thailand. According to Dumnern’s 
practical explanation in her seminar at the Sangkeet Sin Center226, mawlum is separated into four

categories, consisting of: 1) mawlum klon (หมอลํากลอน), 2) mawlum ruang, 3) mawlum phithikam (หมอ
ลําพิธีกรรม) or maw lum phi fa, and 4) mawlum bettalet (หมอลําเบ็ดเตล็ด). Later on, she demonstrates the 
use of lai (modes) performed by the khaen, whose melodic lines and accompaniments must 
correspond and interact with each other and the vocal parts. For instance, when performing 
mawlum klon, the use of modes to accompany the vocal is divided into three types—namely, the 
use of lai thang san, the C, F, G major pentatonic scales for a short performance (lum thang san) 
which contains faster tempos, and lai thang yai (A, D, E) for a longer performance with a slow 
tempo, in which the vocalist sings longer poems. Meanwhile, for lum teay performances, which 
are classified into four types that are mainly used for entertainment (i.e., teay tammada, teay burma, 
teay khong, and teay hua node tan [เต้ยหัวโนนตาล]), the accompanying player (khaen) will perform 
melodic patterns that are musically related to the vocalist’s parts. 
 
The employment of Buddha’s teachings, the Jataka Tales, and other folklore, is also observed 
in the performance of mawlum ruang, which requires additional mawlum players to perform 
different characters, in a similar way to a theatrical performance setting. The application of lai 
to accompany this performance may be varied and depends on the story that was chosen. The 
name of mawlum ruang is also referred to as mawlum moo, when performed by a group of people. 
As for the mawlum phithikam, it can be referred by to other names, e.g., mawlum slong (inspection), 
or mawlum phi fa; this performance is practiced alongside traditional beliefs whose purpose is to 
cure illness. Here, the khaen player accompanies the vocal section by performing lai yai, and the 
mawlum invites the local spirits to possess their bodies by using poetic lyrics. The mawlum player 
may also dance around the patients to investigate and later reveal to the patient’s family the 
sickness of the patient and how to cure it. The final category of mawlum performance, explained 
by Chaweewan in her seminar, concerns the practice of mawlum bettalet, which is related to 
distinctive regional singing methods. For instance, two distinct styles of vocal melodic lines—
consisting of the singing techniques of phu tai phukao (which is located in the Phu Phan 
mountain range) and phu tai yai isan (located near the Mekong River)—can be performed by 
using different regional accents, and the expressions assumed when singing may refer to the 
character of the region’s people. 
 
4.6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
 
Isan nuea music is the musical culture of north-east Thailand’s upper region, which comprises 
fourteen provinces with Thai-Lao communities. One of the most prominent instruments in 
",456,2891
124," 
CHAPTER 4:  Investigating the Musical Aspects of dontri isan nuea 
 
 
108 
this region is the khaen that can be used as a solo or accompaniment instrument. When 
performing khaen, isan nuea musicians make the sound of drones, which is one of the region’s 
most distinctive musical elements. Isan nuea musicians also employ the concept of lai to create 
music or produce a spontaneous improvisation. Aside from this meaning of lai, which refers 
to the sound of traditional modes, this word can also relate to the name of traditional music, 
as well the name of a regional music accent.  
 
Unlike Thai classical music, several isan nuea instruments appear to have adopted the use of 
Western instruments tuning known as sieng sakon, which can be more effective when 
transcribed using a keyboard. The transcription of Sombat Simlah’s khaen performance led us 
to the results that isan nuea music is typically constructed using intervallic techniques within the 
key. In addition, the use of question-and-answer methods similar to those used in jazz 
improvisation, as well as chords produced by combining drone sounds and pentatonic scales, 
which are equivalent to a suspended chord in jazz harmony, give isan nuea music a homophonic 
texture that sets it apart from Thai classical music. 
 
Thamnong kern, thamnong lak, and thamnong yoi are three distinct sections used in isan nuea 
performances, as Sombat Simlah’s transcription demonstrated. Buahong Phajung Lamut 
Sapphat and Boomma Kaowong’s performances reveal that while performing isan nuea 
musicians frequently emphasize the rhythmic accents on the upbeat, comparable to a swing 
feel. Three traditional melodies, “Lai Lom Phat Phrao,” “Lai Nok Sai Bin Kham Thung,” and 
“Lai Teay Khong,” whose melodic construction is based on pentatonic scales which are also 
capable of combing with contemporary jazz harmony, particularly the latter composition, 
which can be integrated with Coltrane’s chord progression, “Countdown.” As a result, my 
arrangement of “Lai Teay Khong” is able to express both memorable isan nuea melodies as well 
as distinct jazz chord progressions. Other rhythms used in jazz compositions, such as hip hop, 
Latin, and 5/4 odd times, also effectively interweave with isan nuea traditional melodies. Isan 
nuea modes, such as lai yai, and lai sutsanaen can be employed in jazz compositional process to 
accentuate the character of isan nuea music during the improvisational section as the preliminary 
works reveal.

Examining the Musical  
Features of dontri paktai (Traditional 
Music of Southern Thailand) 
 
 
5.1 INTRODUCTION  
 
Chapter 5 highlights the musical practices of southern Thailand, which include nora music (Thai 
Buddhist music), and rong ngeng (Thai Muslim music). I begin with a brief overview of 
hypotheses of nora music’s origins, followed by a critical analysis of nora musical instruments, 
and how they function in nora ensembles. I then present some examples of nora repertoire, 
including the pieces “Patcha” and “Chak Bai,” and describe how I incorporated nora musical 
elements into a prototype composition. My discussion of rong ngeng performance also begins 
with a brief history of the genre, followed by a stylistic comparison between southeast and 
southwest rong ngeng performances. The musical instruments used in these two versions of rong 
ngeng, as well as their musical textures, are next examined. I then present two musical 
compositions used in southeast rong ngeng performances, followed by a discussion of 
compositional techniques I applied in my preliminary work that integrate rong ngeng music 
components with jazz composition.

THE TRADITIONAL MUSIC OF SOUTHERN THAILAND (DONTRI PAKTAI) 
 
Located on the Malay Peninsula, southern Thailand functions as a bridge between the 
Andaman Sea (bordering the Indian Ocean) and the Gulf of Thailand (which connects to the 
South China Sea). This location has played a role in the richness of the musical cultures of the 
people of southern Thailand, which stem from the multicultural practices influenced by the 
activities of maritime trade and religious exchange in the area. In this region, two distinct types 
of traditional music have been practiced for many generations, both integrated with the 
religions of its people: the musical culture of Thai Mahayana Buddhists, and the musical culture 
of Thai Muslims.227 Among the numerous musical styles of these two communities, I examine 
only two traditional music customs for the purposes of this study: nora, a musical 
accompaniment of the theatrical performances by Thai Mahayana Buddhists; and rong ngeng, the 
music culture that accompanies traditional Thai-Mulism dances. 
 
5.2 NORA 
 
There are two main hypotheses about the origins of the traditional practice of nora or manora 
(in the dialect of central Thailand). One hypothesis is promoted by prince Damrong 
Rajanubhab, a pioneering Thai historian who believed that this traditional practice may have 
been influenced by a similar theatrical performance style founded during the Ayutthaya period 
known as lakhon chatri. This hypothesis is based on ancient scripts referring to homages to nora 
teachers (bot wai khru), groups of nora troupes who came to Ayutthaya to learn this performance 
style and brought it back to southern Thailand.228 The other hypothesis is that this traditional 
culture was originally developed in southern Thailand (presumably in Phattahalung Province) 
and significantly evolved in this particular area—and it only later influenced theatrical 
performance practices in central Thailand.229 
 
Much like with other histories of traditional cultures based on oral tradition, to find the actual 
answer to this question may depend on personal beliefs and local customs. As such, it may still 
                                                        
227 Other than these two musical traditions, music practices in this region include Talung (shadow play music), 
Kalor (funeral music), Li mont, and Toa Khurm (ritual music), and Silat (martial arts music) See more,

be difficult to obtain the exact answer as to the origins of nora performance. However, in a 
practical sense—and from the perspective of empirical observation—the performance of nora 
indeed has a deep connection with the spirit of southern Thailand, through its dialects, beliefs, 
and customs, which can be especially observed in Phattahalung, Nakhon Si Thammarat, 
Songkhla, and Trang Provinces. In these areas, the musical performances authentically project 
the character of the traditional culture of southerners, which is quite distinct from other 
traditional practices in Thailand. The purpose of nora practices is also divided into two 
categories which are employed in both formal ceremonies and for entertainment. The formal 
category is recognized as nora rong khru230, and is purposely practiced for communicating 
ancestries, healing illness, and worshipping local spirits. 
 
PI NORA 
 
Understanding the musical practices employed to accompany nora performances begins with 
the fundamental concepts of the instruments and techniques used in nora musical ensembles. 
The pi nora is a reed instrument similar in appearance to the pi nai used in Thai classical music 
ensembles, but is slightly smaller. The tuning system of the pi nora produces seven diatonic 
pitches per octaves over a range of approximately 2 octaves. These pitches are B, C, D, E, F, 
G, A, B ­, C­, D,­ E,­, F ­, G­, A­,  B­­ C­­, D­­ in the standard model (42 cm).  Similar 
to isan nuea instruments, some pi nora adapt the Western tuning system, which allows a pi nora 
player (also known as nai pi nora in southern dialect) to perform with Western musical 
instruments, especially with accompanying instruments such as keyboards, which are recently 
employed in nora performances. In contrast to the homophonic texture of isan nuea produced 
by the khaen and phin, or the idiomatic heterophony and polyphonic stratification produced by 
Thai classical music ensembles, the musical texture of nora music seems to be largely 
monophonic in texture, with the pi nora acting as the only instrument to produce significant 
melodic lines of the nora musical ensemble.231 For this reason, understanding how the pi nora 
functions in nora performances is crucial for jazz composers who are interested in this particular 
style of music.   
                                                        
230 There are two types of nora rong khru: 1.) nora rong khru yai (spending 3 days and 2 nights), and nora rong khru 
yai lek (taking 1 day and 1 night), which are generally held from March to September, with the ceremony starting 
between Wednesday and Friday. For more, see the Provincial Cultural office of Songkhla, Ministry of Culture, 
Thailand. <https://www.m-culture.go.th/songkhla/ewt_news.php?nid=445&filename=index> (7 May 2017). 
231 I exclude the musical pitches that are produced by the mong (a set of two gong bells) which function as a 
rhythmic indicator (from a southern Thai musician’s perspective), more than contributing the necessary melodic 
movement to nora ensembles. More details on the mong are later described in this chapter.

CHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  
 
 
112 
KHEUN HUA PI TECHNIQUE 
 
One of the prominent instrumental techniques of the pi nora that can be observed in nora 
performances is known as kheun hua pi (ขึEนหัวปี6), in which a pi nora player establishes the proper 
number of solo sections at the beginning of performances (a solo introduction). To perform 
this technique, the nai pi nora starts by repeating a single pitch, gradually increasing the tempo, 
similar to tremolo effects on a lower pitch of a wind instrument which may be heard in jazz. 
This usually starts on D, before adding musical ornaments, such as trills or upper and lower 
mordents, in the lower register, before gradually ascending to a high pitch (which usually is a 
high D), before descending to the low pitch again. This is an example of the characteristic 
complex sound of the pi nora. 
 
To further illustrate the khuen hua pi technique, I have transcribed a performance of the nora 
music ensemble from Songkhla Rajabhat University in Songkhla Province, southern Thailand 
(Figure 5.1)232, considered one of the outstanding nora music ensembles in the southern region. 
In mm.1-2, the nai pi nora performs a rapid repetition of the pitch D, before using the pattern 
of sixteenth and thirty-second notes—primarily consisting of the notes D and F—in mm.4-5 
to introduce a new set of repeated pitches an ascension to the new target pitch—the note A in 
m.12. Later on, in m.13, the application of trills from A to B can also be examined as a new set 
of two repetitive pitches, which then approach the note G in m.14. Afterwards, from mm.19-
28, the melodic repetitive patterns undulate, primarily including the pitches of G, D, A, B—
with the B note observable as the highest note in these patterns which eventually transfers to 
the higher note, F#, in m.30.  
 
The melodic lines of this example of khuen hua pi technique also gradually ascend, to repeatedly 
reference the pitch B (m.32), and later reach the high D (m. 35)— the highest pitch capable of 
being produced by the standard model of the pi nora. After reaching this highest pitch, the pi 
nora plays descending melodic patterns to the new lower target pitches, including the note of 
F# in mm.38-41, the note of D in m.42, the pitch of A in m.45, the pitch of E in m.48, before 
                                                        
232 Figure 5.1 was transcribed from the performance of the nora music ensemble from Songkhla Rajabhat 
University (0.00-1.03) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO6_pkO3wZk> uploaded by Kon Dontri, (27 
June 2019). Please note that I excluded the application of tremolo and ornament signs to demonstrate the pitch 
levels and rhythmic notation to resemble the original performance as much as possible. The utilization of khuen 
hua pi technique also may be slightly varied based on the regional influences and distinct teaching methods.

CHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  
 
 
113 
lastly returning to the pitch of D—the original pitch of this entire melodic pattern—and 
ultimately transitioning to the next composition of the nora performance in mm.50-53.233  
 
It is important to note that the khuen hua pi technique can also be referred to as phleng hua pi (a 
short introduction song for pi nora). This instrumental technique operates as the introductory 
music of a nora performance to draw the audience’s attention, and it is placed within a longer 
overture section known as thon homrong. The utilization of drum rolls, the repetitive ching 
patterns, and the two distinct, constant sounds produced by two gong bells are also employed 
to rhythmically accompany this short introductory section created by pi nora techniques.

THAP 
 
Thap is an important pair of percussion instruments employed in nora musical ensembles. It 
consists of two separate drums that are given different tunings—one for a higher tone known 
as nuay chap or luk chap in central Thai dialect, and one for a lower tone called nuay thoeng (เทิง) 
or luk thoeng. One of the main reasons why thap is so important to nora ensembles is because its 
",89,535
131," 
CHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  
 
 
115 
functions must precisely synchronize with the dance postures and movements of nora dancers. 
To provide the best illustration of the importance of using thap in nora performances, Kuan 
Tuanyok, a national artist and one of the most respected traditional south Thai musicians, has 
emphasized the importance of the application of thap in nora and nang talung (a southern style 
of shadow-puppet theater), stating that, “the first instrument employed in nora performance 
was thap, and at that time, there was not a melodic instrument, such as pi nora. Therefore, thap 
was [the] only instrument used to accompany singing, acting, or playing for both nora and nang 
talung.”234 
 
There are a variety of techniques in playing the thap. The nai thap (a thap player) uses the hands 
to hit the drumheads in various locations, producing four distinct sounds from the instrument: 
1) chap or pap, a treble tone produced by striking the right hand to the center nuay chap (a higher-
tone drum) while using the left hand to mute the sound at the hollow part of the tail of the 
same drum; 2) tik, a treble tone (lower than chap) produced by a similar process to chap, except 
the player employs the right-hand hit at the edge of the drumhead instead of the center; 3) 
thoeng (เทิง), which is a bass tone produced by a thap player using both the left and right hand to 
hit the center of both drums; and lastly 4) tid, a bass tone created by a similar method to thoeng, 
but here, the nai thap concentrates on producing more bass tones with the right hand compared 
to the thoeng sound.235 
 
KLONG, MONG, AND CHING 
 
Other musical instruments of nora musical ensembles that I have found to have potential use 
in musical hybridization projects include: 1) klong (known as klong charti in the central Thai 
accent), 2) mong (referred to as khong khu in the central Thai dialect), and 3) ching. The klong is a 
drum similar to the klong thad (large bass drums) used in Thai classical music ensembles. 
However, the size of the klong used in the nora ensemble is much smaller than the klong thad 
and is performed with only one drum—in contrast to klong thad, which consists of two types 
of drum known as klong thad tua phu (a male drum) and klong thad tua mia (a female drum). The 
sound of the klong is produced by using a pair of drum sticks; this produces low bass tones and

116 
contributes a strong downbeat to emphasize a more rhythmic dynamic in the movements of a 
nora dancer. Common drum techniques in klong rhythmic patterns include drum rolls and 
playing around the edge of the drum with sticks to produce a more wooden sound.  
 
The purpose of the mong (a set of two gong bells) in nora ensembles can be divided into two 
categories: 1) using the mong to operate as a rhythmic indicator or timekeeper, and 2) producing 
the tuning pitches for nora dancers when they are required to sing lyrics (which primarily consist 
of Buddha’s teachings, paying homage to teachers, descriptions of their postures, or improvised 
rhymes to entertain the audience).236 The mong sound consists of two separate sounds in 
descending perfect fifths; for example, a mong in D produces a D for the higher pitch, and a G 
for the lower pitch. The mong player (nai mong) provides alternating sounds of D, G, D, G to 
indicate continuous time for nora ensembles. Alternatively, the instrument can be performed 
only as D or G, or it can be rearranged to a different pattern of the two notes (e.g., D, D, D, 
G) based on the type of composition accompanying the nora dancers while performing. In 
addition, the ching—which consists of undamped and damped sounds, similar to Thai classical 
music—is also be played by mong players by using their one hand to hold a gong mallet and 
their other to play a ching instrument attached to a box that contains a set of two gong bells. 
Please also note that the tuning of the mong is also variable and based on the individual 
characters of nora ensembles. In my observations, the tunings in D and E♭ occur widely when 
transcribing nora music, and the tuning in E can be often observed in a different kind of 
traditional performance known as nang talung (a shadow puppet play).  
 
An example of typical rhythmic patterns implemented in nora performances is illustrated in 
Figure 5.2, my transcription of a nora dance called rum nora sip-song bot (twelve dance postures) 
performed by Tammanit Nikomrat, a nora expert from Songkhla Province who currently 
teaches nora performance at Thaksin University in Songkhla Province. Tammanit is well-known 
to both local and international audiences and is also renowned as an inventive nora performer 
who has incorporated this style of southern Thai performance with other traditional 
performances that may be seen in other parts of southern Thailand.237 I selected four rhythmic 
elements of the performance for musical analysis. The first (mm.1-5 in Figure 5.2) is the

performance of a short solo of a pi nora player (khuen hua pi technique), a monophonic texture 
without rhythmic accompaniment in this particular performance; followed by the signal of the 
thap player in m.6, who plays two quarter note beats to indicate the entire ensemble to start to 
perform in m.7. The second example is a rhythmic synchronization between the patterns of 
thap and klong that contributes a solid rhythmic sense to the nora dancer, which can be seen in 
multiple instances. Based on my observations of these thap patterns, I discovered that the 
respective chap and thoeng sounds play a critical role in accompanying the nora dancer, and the 
application of the thoeng sound in the second downbeat (as illustrated by the letter “T”) provides 
strong rhythmic accents for the performance.  
 
The third example displays the consistent rhythmic patterns of a set of two gongs sounded in 
E♭ and A♭, with the ching patterns emphasizing every downbeat also functioning as a time 
indicator. In the fourth example it is noticeable that the klong patterns start to change at m.12 
yet still rhythmically coincide with the thap pattern, which seems to be more unpredictable. 
Although thap players and klong players usually generate their rhythmic patterns independently, 
the synchronization of their rhythms can still be observed in their performances as emphasizing 
the downbeats for nora dancers. Nora musicians also rely on the sound of the mong as a 
timekeeper, which can be heard throughout nora performances.

NORA REPERTOIRES AND PERFORMANCE METHODS 
 
As mentioned earlier, nora performances in the south of Thailand may be partly influenced by 
the cultural practices of the country’s center. Indeed, the use of nora repertoires to accompany 
nora dances may be seen in repertoires of Thai classical music as well. In a study by Katawut 
",76,505

CHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  
 
 
119 
Promil on the pi nora performing techniques of Umnad Nuniad238, a pi nora master and respected 
teacher from Phatthalung Province, Katawut discusses Umnad’s repertoire in his nora 
performances. Some of the compositions he plays are also used in Thai classical music 
performances, including “Patcha” (overture song), “Phama (Burma) Rum Khwan,” “Phama 
Thaeng Kob (พม่าแทงกบ),” “Chak Bai” (also known as Jin Lo Reua [จีนโล้เรือ]), and “Khang Khao 
Kin Kluay (ค้างคาวกินกล้วย).”239 While nora musicians may employ traditional compositions that 
originate from other regions, the method and performance of such compositions are distinct 
to nora practice.240 Please note that the nora repertories used in nora performances these days 
also include several phleng luk thung241 (Thai country-folk songs) compositions—a category 
which is, arguably, able to provide greater entertainment and excitement to local audiences. 
Such compositions may be performed as instrumental music to accompany nora dancers and 
sometimes even singing by nora performers. 
 
The order of nora performances also varies depending on the practices of different regions and 
provinces. As an example for this study, I would like to briefly describe the nora performance 
methods used for entertainment (in contrast to nora rong khru, which is a ritual ceremony) as 
practiced by the troupe of a nora master, Tammanit Nikomrat, of Songkhla Province. 
Traditional nora performances (nora boran), as explained by Tammanit, can be separated into 
eight types. These include:  
 
1) nora musicians performing a short ceremonial piece of music to summon local   
spirits for protection and ask for permission to construct nora theaters;  
2) nora musicians performing overture compositions (homrong) to announce to

instruments and stylistic traits into modern urban sounds. Phleng luk thung music videos also invoke images of 
objects of rural life: fishing nets, agricultural tools, and costumes. The modern city gives rise to modern music.

4) the first performances of a group of apprentices of nora dance (comprising two to 
four people), including nora dancers singing behind the curtain to provide excitement to 
audiences and performing the first dance postures on the stage, nora dancers’ performance of 
sitting postures and their related singing performances, and lastly, nora performers’ second 
dance postures;  
5) the performance of phran, a comedic character who provides a sense of amusement 
to the audience;  
6) the performance of the nora master of the troupe;  
7) the second of performance phran to introduce a selected short play; and  
8) the performance of apprentices, nora dancers, and the nora master in a play 
(theatrical performance).242 
 
To apply the musical knowledge of nora performance practically in my hybridization project, I 
have selected three notable compositions that exhibit influential characteristics of this 
traditional music style. The first transcription is “Chak Bai” (Figure 5.3)243, a slow nora dance 
accompaniment song recorded by Sirichai Vejkul, a nora musician from Nakhon Si Thammarat 
province. The second is identifiable in its short melodic patterns used for introducing the 
transformation of dance postures to nora dancers, called a “Sot Soi (สอดสร้อย)” pattern, which 
transcribed from Tammanit Nikomrat’s ensemble (Figure 5.4)244. The third is “Patcha,” which 
is used in the overture section (homrong) (Figure 5.5)245 transcribed from Umnad Nuniad’s 
performance. (Please note that these transcriptions omit ornamentation due to my primary 
focus on the melodic lines of nora music.)246

The melodic construction of “Chak bai” is made up of 28 measures in a 2/4 time signature 
that are repeated twice. The melodic structure of this piece is also built on a C major pentatonic 
scale, similar to melodic constructions of Thai classical and isan nuea music, with the G note

operating as a marker for the beginning and conclusion of musical phrases. Unlike khaen 
performances of isan nuea music, which are constructed by using several interval patterns, the 
melodic patterns in “Chak Bai,” a southern Thai composition, appear to be based on stepwise 
motions with the wide skip interval evident only in m.6.  
 
Similar to the melody of “Chak bai,” the melodic construction of “Patcha,” as performed in 
Umnad Nuniad’s version, is also based on the C major pentatonic scale, with the note G used 
at the beginning and end of its several musical phrases, and D at the end. Applying the same 
method of jazz analysis of Chapter 3, the fundamental patterns of this composition are also 
based on G-A-C-D-E (5-6-1-2-3) and E-G-A-C (3-5-6-1), both of which can be found in 
several locations throughout the performance. Furthermore, the melody of “Patcha” is also 
made up of a combination of several short motifs in quarter-note rhythms, and the repetition, 
such as C-C, D-D-, E-E, and G-G can be utilized to intertwine its musical phrases together. 
 
5.3 A PROTOTYPE COMPOSITION 
 
By working with these three musical elements in jazz composition, I was able to compose the 
contemporary jazz piece “Manora,” which musically expresses the sound of nora performance 
(Figure 5.6). In the A section, I decided to manifest the specific character of the melody of 
“Patcha.” I did so by implementing some of the melodic motions from mm.1-16 of my 
transcription of Umnad Nuniad to construct the bass part—performed by a keyboard in this 
section. For the double bass part in the A section, I also composed a retrograde version of 
these melodic lines. Together with the bass lines generated by the keyboard part, they produce 
contrary motion, which contributes an interesting musical idea to the composition. For the B 
section, I continued to examine the application of kheun hua pi techniques by utilizing the sound 
of a soprano saxophone to reference the sound of the pi nora. The traditional technique on pi 
nora was initially composed based on the pitch D—a similar sound to those of kheun hua pi 
techniques, with the ascension to the higher pitches of the notes G and A. In addition, the 
double bass part of the B section also essentially imitates the perpetual sound of D alternating 
with G, similar to the patterns created by mong players in nora ensembles.  
 
Moving on to the compositional methods in the C section: here, I selected the memorable 
melodic lines of “Patcha” and began to transform their original pitches, and rearrange the 
rhythmic structures from the transcription (starting from m.35), to accommodate the main 
",446,2741
140," 
CHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  
 
 
124 
melody section of “Manora.” To avoid the duplication of the melodic movement of the simple 
melody, I also decided to employ the key modulation of the second repeat of the melody part. 
Another noticeable musical element that I included in this composition is the “Sot Soi” pattern, 
in the E section. Because the characteristic sound of the “Soi Sot” pattern is simple, 
memorable, and frequently heard when nora performers change their postures, implementing 
this memorable melodic line can clearly signal the unique sound of nora performances to the 
audience. In the F section, I decided to include the melodic patterns for “Chak Bai,” which I 
transcribed from Sirichai Vejkul’s performance and then transposed up a minor third. 
However, in this section—which contains no rhythmic adjustments—my aim was to provide 
the sound of nora music with as minimal change as possible in order to balance compositional 
practices between traditional and modern aspects and render an accurate characterization of 
nora music to the audience. Indeed, working on blending these selected musical elements of 
nora music into a small jazz ensemble can provide me with practical methods, as well as 
generating more innovative compositional ideas that can be later utilized for musical 
hybridization in jazz orchestra writing.247

5.4 RONG NGENG  
 
Rong ngeng is one of several musical practices of Thai Muslims in southern Thailand. The origins 
of this style of music are both vibrant and fascinating, as Thai Muslim music can be interpreted 
as an exemplary case of the musical transculturation of Western, Arabic, and multiple local 
cultures in the Malay peninsula.248 As Prapad Krupradub states in his study “Rong Ngeng: Music 
and Folk Dance in the South of Thailand,” the origin of rong ngeng—which refers to a dancing 
style that may have been influenced by overseas traders, in particular the Portuguese, Spanish, 
Dutch, and Arabs—can be also traced to the area around Java, before later moving to the Malay 
peninsula.249 As Lawrence N. Ross notes, “Rong ngeng is an old term that goes back to 
fourteenth-century Java, and has commonly stood, since that time, for some type of music 
ensemble featuring a female singer-dancer—if not a term for the dancer, herself—throughout 
                                                        
248 The modern national border between Thailand and Malaysia was formed as a result of the Anglo-Siamese 
Treaty in 1909, as previously stated in Chapter 3 (the modern Thai nation section). Wyatt, Thailand: A Short History, 
192-193.

the Malay-speaking world.”250 However, it seems that most historical documents may 
emphasize the development of rong ngeng performances during the Portuguese colonial period251 
and somewhat neglect the crucial discussion of rong ngeng music associated with theatrical 
performance during the twentieth century. David Goldsworthy states that 
 
These authors’ extrapolations of rong ngeng to explain history all miss a crucial point: that regardless of 
connections to early colonial contact rong ngeng is a more recent phenomenon whose roots lie primarily 
in transformations to early twentieth-century popular Malayan dance hall and theater music, rather than 
an archaic form perpetuated from earlier centuries. Not to discount connections with the older roots, 
but recent history is more germane to what make rong ngeng distinctive.252 
 
Tan Sooi Beng, when discussing the origins of rong ngeng during the post-Portuguese period, 
has referred to the ethnic diversity of rong ngeng troupes in Melaka, later emphasizing its peaks, 
which were comparable to the performance of Malay theaters: 
 
It is believed that the ronggeng developed during the post-Portuguese period in Melaka, and ronggeng 
troupes comprising performers of different ethnic origins still provide music and entertainment during 
Malay and Baba…And, folk ronggeng songs evolved into modern popular genres and were introduced to 
all parts of Malaya through bangsawan, the first urban commercial Malay theater. It evolved in the late 
nineteenth century and reached its peak prior to and during the Second World War—in the 1920s, 1930s, 
and early 1940s.253 
 
As previously indicated by these four researchers, whether rong ngeng performances originated 
in Java or the Malay Peninsula is still a source of debate. However, it is significant that this 
performance is one of the musical traditions of Southeast Asian Muslim communities, which 
still can be witnessed in the coastal cities across Java and the Malay Peninsula, as well as several 
provinces in southern Thailand, of particular relevance to the aims of my composition 
project.254 
 
The traditional practices of rong ngeng for both dancing and accompaniment in Thailand can be 
divided into two geographical categories, namely, 1) the style of rong ngeng located in the

254 I would like to clarify that rong ngeng is a common tradition among Muslim communities in the Malay peninsula 
and some parts of Indonesia, and it is also known as Malaysian folk music. And, similar to the northeast Thai 
music that can be also observed as the traditional music of Laos. Nevertheless, because my research focuses on 
musical aspects of jazz compositions rather than sociocultural discussion. For this chapter, I will only consider 
the example of rong ngeng, which has been practiced among Thai-Muslim communities.

southeast part of Thailand (the gulf of Thailand), which includes Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat 
Provinces, and 2) those rong ngeng performances by the Thai-Muslim communities along the 
Andaman coastline (southwest Thailand) (e.g., Satun, Phang-nga [พังงา], Krabi, and Trang 
provinces, as well as Lanta and Li-pe islands).255 The distinctive performances of these two 
different styles of rong ngeng can be observed in the selected instruments of the musical 
ensembles, the postures of the dancers, and the original purpose of the performances.   
 
The origins of rong ngeng practice in the southeast part of Thailand, according to Prapad 
Krupradub, traces back to the musical entertainment of governors or sultans in this particular 
area (and, more specifically, to Phya Phiphit Senamad [พระยาพิพิธเสนามาตย์ฯ], a sultan of Yaring [ยะ
หริ.ง], which is present-day Pattani Province).256 Later, this style spread to the communities 
through traditional Muslim theatrical performances known as mak yong (มะโย่ง) (which are related 
to nora performances). As a consequence, the practice of rong ngeng in this region significantly 
concerns the meticulous posture of rong ngeng dancers (comprising both males and females), 
and the instruments used in this musical ensemble include Western instruments such as the 
violin, mandolin, and accordion; both of these factors are evident in the practice of musical 
translation, as mentioned earlier. 
 
The practice of rong ngeng in the southwest of Thailand can also be separated into two sub-
categories, consisting of rong ngeng chao le (rong ngeng of the chao le people [ชาวเล] and rong ngeng 
tanyoug [ตันหยง], concentrated in the Krabi Province and surrounding areas). Unlike the 
performances of rong ngeng in the southeastern area, rong ngeng chao le and rong ngeng tanyoug were 
originally practiced among the fishing communities and in villages along the coast of the 
Andaman Sea. Therefore, most of the performances in this style include lyrics that express the 
fisherman’s lifestyle, sea lullabies, and ordinary stories of village-style courtships; these lyrics 
are occasionally generated by improvisational processes of vocalists (klon sot). In addition, the 
musical instruments employed in the rong ngeng performances of southwest Thailand seem to 
be fewer in number—consisting only of the violin, two different sizes of a frame drum called 
rebana257 (or rammana, in the central-Thai dialect), and one gong—compared to the rong ngeng 
musical ensembles of the southeastern part of the country.

256 Krupradub, “Rong Ngeng: Music and Folk Dance in the South of Thailand,” 61. 
257 Please also note that there are several different rebana models employed in various traditional music styles in 
south Thailand. The rebana type referred to in rong ngeng performances in both the southeast and west is a single 
drum head that sizes around 25 to 60 centimeters, and traditionally made of goat and cow skins. See more in:

CHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  
 
 
128 
Another striking difference in the performance methods between these two regional rong ngeng 
styles (southeastern and southwestern) concerns the practice of wai khru ceremonies (paying 
homage to teachers). Nevertheless, such ceremonies can only be investigated in rong ngeng chao 
le and rong ngeng tanyong performances where the musicians perform a “Lagu Dua”(ลาฆูดูวอ) (for 
rong ngeng tanyoung) and “Lagu Du Wa (ลาฆูดูวา)” (for rong ngeng chao le) to pay the local spirits for 
protection.258 (Please also note that different dance postures, costumes, and slightly different 
dialects are observable in the respective performances of rong ngeng chao le and rong ngeng 
tanyong.) 
 
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND TEXTURE  
 
The rong ngeng musical ensembles in the southeast, as previously indicated, include several 
Western instruments, such as mandolin and accordion, that can be used to create harmony. As 
a result, the musical texture of rong ngeng in the region is identifiable in its homophony—which 
is similar to isan nuea music but differs from Thai classical music and nora performances, as well 
as the rong ngeng performances of the southwest region (tanyoug and chao le), which only use one 
violin. The primary function of the violin in rong ngeng musical ensembles (for both regions) is 
similar to its purpose in other traditional music styles of Europe, the Americas and elsewhere, 
serving to execute main melodic lines. Another technique of Thai rong ngeng violinists which is 
similarly identifiable in Western classical music, as well as in a number of traditional and 
classical music styles, is the use of the double stop. The use of the accordion and mandolin 
applies to only to southeast rong ngeng ensembles, and is intended to support violinists primarily 
by constructing unisons or octave unisons in the melodic lines of rong ngeng compositions. Other 
fundamental accompaniment techniques—such as playing intervals or triads—are also 
frequently observable in the performances of the accordion and mandolin. 
 
The percussion instruments used in rong ngeng performances in southern Thailand can also be 
divided into two categories, by region. In general, southwestern rong ngeng performances use 
fewer percussion instruments than southeastern rong ngeng performances. In both regions, rong 
ngeng performances usually feature two sizes of the rebana (rammana), a larger drum for the

fundamental rhythmic patterns and a smaller drum (luk kut) for generating variations such as 
improvisational fills or off-beat accents. Both regions also feature one unpitched gong (or khong 
in the central-Thai dialect) in rong ngeng performances, utilized to emphasize the downbeats.  
 
In contrast to rong ngeng performances in the southwest, the percussion instruments in 
southeastern ensembles include additional percussion instruments such as maracas and the 
tambourine. Because of these larger instrumentations of southeastern ensembles, and my 
interest in musical texture, I decided that for this project, I would provide one concise 
illustration of a performance from the southeastern region’s style. This example was taken from 
Atipon Anukool’s research on southeastern rong ngeng performances.259 The Ussakmeemala 
ensemble, one of the most well-known rong ngeng groups from Pattani Province in the southeast, 
performed this piece, a composition called “Oh Sa Loma” (Figure 5.7).260 (Please note that 
while transcribing or studying rong ngeng compositions, the use of a 2/4 time signature is avoided 
due to the lack of perpetual beats generated by the ching, which are often heard in other 
traditional Thai music styles.)

musical texture of southeastern rong ngeng.

In this example, the principal functions of the violin and accordion—both of which perform 
the main melodic lines of the composition—are comparable. In addition, the accordion player 
carries additional responsibility for producing fundamental harmonies to rong ngeng musical 
textures (e.g., employing simple triadic voicings). The mandolin players in rong ngeng ensembles 
either play an accompaniment role by performing certain intervals (typically the interval of a 
third) or melodic lines in unison with the violin players, as is demonstrated in the second 
ending. In a standard setting, the rhythm sections of southeastern rong ngeng ensembles may 
consist of three players—with the sounds of the gong and maracas performed by the one 
percussionist and serving to signify the downbeat accents. The sound of the rebana also 
constructs perpetual rhythmic patterns that signify and guide the distinguished stylistic 
rhythmic patterns used in rong ngeng performance. To provide complicated rhythmic ideas—in 
particular, to create syncopated rhythms—rong ngeng ensembles also add one more percussion 
player on luk kut to create a syncopated character against rabana patterns, as seen in the 
transcription.  
 
RHYTHMIC PATTERNS 
 
In the southeastern and southwestern genres of rong ngeng, rhythmic patterns are performed in 
a number of ways. Tan Sooi Beng has explained the application of Malay words to symbolize 
the two dissimilar sounds that are constructed by the rebana, namely tak (treble sounds), and 
",244,1671
147," 
CHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  
 
 
131 
dung (bass sounds).261 This is similar to Lawrence N. Ross’s demonstration that the word dung 
refers to a center stroke produced by the low sound, while tak denotes the high timbre 
produced by striking the player’s hand against the edge of the instrument. In addition, Ross 
also mentions that the word duk may apply to the muted treble sound similar to tak, but here, 
the rebana player uses one hand to mute the drum skin.262 Adapting this significant rhythmic 
information can provide jazz composers with a better understanding of rebana performances 
and also develop the practical concept of rhythmic patterns performed in both types of rong 
ngeng performance. However, due to regional accents and the diverse dialects that may differ 
between Muslims in Thailand and Malaysia, I have decided to, in my rebana transcriptions, use 
two percussion lines where the top line refers to the treble sound and the bottom line refers to 
the bass tone. The “x”, meanwhile, designates the muted sounds, in order to substantially 
reduce any confusion around the letters used in my method. 
 
To provide demonstrations of the rhythmic patterns of rong ngeng music practiced in Muslim 
communities in Thailand, I selected performances of a rong ngeng troupe from Satun Province263 
(tanyong in the southwestern region), whose performers are from the Faculty of Fine Arts of 
Songkla Rajabhat University, led by Jansamorn Pholboon.264 Additionally, this performance 
was a subject of a qualitative study conducted using the documentary method and the field 
survey approach, which included interviewing, observing, and learning from a local rong ngeng 
troupe. The three fundamental rhythmic patterns, which were transcribed from the rebana 
performance, are called lagu dua (ลาฆูดูวอ), mak inang (มะอินัง), and sinadong (สินาโด้ง) (Figure 5.8).265

Figure 5.8b: Fundamental rhythmic patterns of rong ngeng tanyong, continued.  
 
In Laga dua, the rong ngeng rhythm is characterized by two measures of a repeating rhythmic 
pattern. This rhythmic pattern is also made up of three groups of treble tones and two groups 
of bass sounds, with the accentuated beat appearing on the second and fourth beats, which is 
interestingly comparable to beats typically accented in many styles of jazz. Throughout the 
performance, it is also performed in triplet pulse. The rhythmic patterns of the rebana employed 
in “Mak Inang” and “Sinadong” also include syncopated sixteenth-note rhythms. Muted 
techniques are evident in both of these rhythmic patterns. Interestingly, the accentuation of 
Mak Inang is comparable to Laga dua, with the second and fourth beats again corresponding to 
emphases on beats 2 and 4 in many 4/4 jazz styles. “Sinadong” rhythmic patterns also feature 
syncopated beats produced by a set of two notes in treble tones and a group of three notes in 
bass tones, with the accented beats placed on the initial downbeat. This rhythmic pattern can 
of course be applied to drum set or congas parts, as I later explain in the discussion of my jazz 
orchestra compositional process (Chapter 7). 
 
For examples of rhythmic patterns of rong ngeng performances in southeastern Thailand, I 
selected for transcription rebana patterns which have been analyzed by Apicha Kantacha in an 
academic forum on “Ronggeng community people in Songkhla” hosted by Prince of Songkhla 
University in Songkhla Province. In this seminar, Apicha, a renowned rong ngeng musician in 
Songkhla Province and the leader of the Ussakmeemala ensemble, provides significant details 
about how rong ngeng music is practiced in the southeastern region, providing examples of 
performances from which I selected three different rhythmic patterns: 1) Asli, 2) Inang, and 3) 
Joget. These are the standard rhythmic patterns that rong ngeng performers from this particular

region must learn and frequently apply to accompany rong ngeng dancers.266 The example of 
these three rebana patterns are displayed in Figure 5.9.267

The fundamental rhythm of the Asli pattern as played by Apicha’s ensemble has a slow tempo 
(indicated as 43 BPM), perhaps similar to the tempos of jazz standards when played as ballads. 
The first measure of the Asli pattern also provide a rhythmic sense similar to the feeling of 
swing in jazz, consisting of dotted eighth notes followed by sixteenth notes. To provide more 
syncopated rhythmic ideas, the rebana player also performs the second sixteenth-note up-beats 
in the bass tone in the second group of patterns. Apicha also mentions that the performance 
of the Asli style is one of the oldest traditional rhythms and is rare in current rong ngeng 
performances.  
                                                        
266 These three standard rhythmic patterns, consisting of Asli, Inang, and Joget can also be observed in the practices 
of Muslim communities in Malaysia; however, from my empirical observations, the distinctions between these 
two regional styles can be explicitly recognized. See more in: Tan Sooi Beng, “From Folk to National Popular 
Music: Recreating Ronggeng in Malaysia.”

The second standard rhythm applied in southeastern rong ngeng performances and represented 
in the above notation is the inang (อินัง) pattern, which is slightly faster the Asli example, and can 
be employed in lullaby songs. It seems that the slow inang is less syncopated in its rhythm than 
the Asli pattern. The fast inang includes syncopated rhythms on the upbeats of the second and 
fourth beats. The rhythmic pattern of the fast inang is also similar to the rhythmic pattern that 
accompanies “Sinadong” in southwestern rong ngeng performances, but with different beats 
emphasized. 
 
The final rhythmic pattern that I transcribed is joget, which is one of the most famous stylistic 
rhythmic patterns in rong ngeng performances in the southeastern region, and perhaps in other 
areas as well. Apicha explains that the origin of this particular rhythm could be associated with 
the traditional dances of the Portuguese. Nowadays, the joget rhythm is famously employed in 
Muslim wedding ceremonies. In addition, the noticeable musical elements in this particular 
rhythm include a set of sixteenth-notes connected to two eighth-notes—which are accented in 
the first down-beats and the second up-beats without any rests. 
 
RONG NGENG COMPOSITIONS 
 
The musical compositions of rong ngeng performances in Thai-Muslim communities have also 
been significantly influenced by Malay folk and film music. Seng Arboo, one of the prominent 
rong ngeng musicians from Pattani province, mentions that some of the musical compositions 
that he uses to accompany southeastern rong ngeng performances are drawn from Malay folk 
music he listened to in his childhood, which he later interpreted and adopted to suit his 
performances.268 The compositional repertoire of rong ngeng music played in the southwestern 
region can also be divided into two categories: 1) compositions significantly influenced by 
Malay folk music during the Second World War, and 2) compositions that contain Thai lyrics 
resulting from the separation of Malay and Thai cultures in the post-war era.269 
 
Although rong ngeng compositions are relatively new when compared to Thai classical and isan 
nuea music, its performance practices have been strongly maintained through oral transmission 
between the different generations of Thai Muslim communities in southern Thailand. In 
particular, rong ngeng performances in southeastern Thailand went through a process of

standardization of dance postures by cultural institutions and local artists. This preserved both 
the original dance postures associated with accompanying compositions, and the rhythmic 
patterns traceable back to the original practices of the sultanate period. 
 
Traditionally, there are at least eight compositions that are famously employed in the rong ngeng 
performances of the southeastern region. These traditional compositions are: “Lagu Dua” 
(which has a distinct melody contains the “Lagu Dua” rhythm of the southwestern region), 
“Lenang (เลนัง),” “Pu Jo Pi Sang (ปูโจ๊ปีซัง),” “Mo Inang Chawa,” “Jitra Sayang,” “Mo Inang Lama,” 
“A Nao De Dee (อาเนาะดิดิl),” and “Bu Nga Rum Pai (บุหงารําไป).”270 I selected two compositions 
from this traditional repertoire to draw on in this project: “Lenang” (Figure 5.10)271 and “Lagu 
Dua” (Figure 5.11).272 The recordings of these songs that I transcribed were by Khadae Wadeng 
(ขาเดร์ แวเด็ง), a nationally renowned artist who is one of the most respected rong ngeng musicians 
in Thailand. . Khadae was also a pioneer of rong ngeng performance in the southeastern region. 
He recorded these two compositions with his well-known ensemble, the Dendung Ussalee 
ensemble (คณะเด็นดังอัสลี)273 formed in 1971 in Pattani Province.274

Unlike other traditional music in Thailand, the melodies of musical compositions for rong ngeng 
performances contain half-step intervals and harmonic minor scale structures that are the result 
of the pitch constructions of Western musical instruments. The melodic lines of “Lenang” are 
created from a G major scale with the half-step between the notes of F# and G, in contrast to 
the penta-centric concept of other traditional Thai music. The melodies of this composition 
",98,663
153," 
CHAPTER 5: Examining the Musical Features of dontri paktai  
 
 
137 
are also based on symmetrical phrases consisting of eight measures of repetition that repeat 
twice. The tempo of “Lenang” also alternates between a slow and a fast section: after the 
second repetition, the tempo increases to double-time. 
 
The melodic lines of “Lagu Dua” outline the sound of the G harmonic scale and include the 
pitches of B♭, E♭, and F♯—pitches that clearly distinguish the harmonic minor scale sound 
from the penta-centric doctrine of Thai classical music, isan nuea music, and even nora music. 
In this recording, Khadae also performs two distinctive sections (melodies A and B), which are 
examples of standard compositional forms and applied in the performances rong ngeng 
southeast. Performances of rong ngeng in this region usually start in a slow tempo and change to 
a fast tempo to provide more excitement, and to avoid monotony for the dancers. Instrumental 
arrangements also shift in such performances—for example, instruments take turns playing the 
melody part of the composition. Interestingly, improvisational methods are rarely identified in 
rong ngeng performances from this region. 
 
5.5 A PROTOTYPE COMPOSITION 
 
To begin thinking through musical hybridization of rong ngeng performances and jazz 
composition for this project, I composed “Mutee Yara,” with the lead sheet included below  
(Figure 5.12). 
 
In this composition designated for a jazz quartet, I utilized the original melody of the Lagu 
Dua composition from southeast Thailand transcribed earlier as the melody part of the B 
section. However, I decided to modulate the original scale of the Lagu Dua melody—G 
harmonic minor—to several different scales, including C, D, and G♭ harmonic minor (in red 
rectangles in Figure 5.12). The prominent musical elements of southwestern rong ngeng—
namely, the individual rhythmic patterns mak inang and sinadong—were also adjusted for use as 
rhythmic accompaniment devices in the rhythm section in the solo parts, as illustrated in the 
D section. To provide a rhythmic character related to the social dances of the rong ngeng 
performance, I also made use of the rhythmic patterns of bolero which are performed by the 
drum, bass, and piano players in the E section. In addition, the melody of this part was a 
reharmonization of the original melody of the Lenang composition that is frequently 
performed in southeast Thailand as a piece of slow dance music. As a result, this melody is

capable of transmitting a surprising sensitivity to the audience who may expect Lagu Dua’s 
melody to be repeated as a melody out. 275

5.6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
 
Nora music is a musical culture practiced by Mahayana Buddhists in southern Thailand, and it 
is intimately associated with nora performances, a type of Thai southern theater. Pi nora, thap, 
klong, mong, and ching are some of the instruments utilized in nora music, with nai pi (a reed player) 
playing a significant role in creating the fundamental melodic lines used in nora music. One of 
the prominent instrumental techniques of pi nora that is capable of being imitated by a soprano 
saxophone is khuen hua pi, which is a single pitch reiteration that begins with lower pitches and 
progresses to higher notes before returning to lower pitches. Another important musical 
characteristic of this traditional music can be linked to the two mong sounds, such as D and G, 
which can be constantly heard alternating throughout nora performances and replicated in bass 
lines, as shown in my prototype composition. The use of nora repertoires has also been linked 
to Thai classical music musical performance repertoires. Unlike the melodies of isan nuea music 
performances, which are predominantly constructed by using intervallic patterns, the melodic 
patterns of southern Thai compositions tend to be based on stepwise motions, as illustrated in 
the transcriptions of “Patcha,” and “Chak Bai.” 
 
Another traditional Thai southern music performance is a rong ngeng performance, which is a 
musical practice of southern Thai Muslims. Unlike other Thai musical traditions, rong 
ngeng performance incorporate the use of western instruments such as the violin and accordion. 
Two distinct regional styles, rong ngeng (tanyoug) in the southwest and rong ngeng in the southeast, 
are distinguished by the instrument, repertoires, and performance methods. The rhythmic 
pattern of rong ngeng’s music, which construed by rebana is one of the most intriguing features 
that can be utilized in jazz composition. These rhythmic patterns can be effectively executed 
by drums, bongo, and conga in jazz ensembles, or employed as rhythmic accompaniments for 
drum solo as demonstrated in my prototype composition. The southwestern region’s rong ngeng 
music compositional repertoire can also be classified into two categories: 1) compositions 
influenced by Malay folk music; 2) compositions with Thai lyrics and adaptations of Thai 
cultures as a result of the separation of Malay and Thai cultures in the postwar era. In addition, 
Malay folk and film music have had a significant influence on rong ngeng repertoires in the 
southeast. Importantly, the melodic lines of rong ngeng compositions contain half-step intervals 
and highlight the sound of a harmonic minor scale, which is dissimilar to the concept of “penta-
centric” in dontri thai doem (Thai classical music) and isan nuea music.

To summarize, the compositional methods of this chapter provide an example of imitating the 
performance methods of southern music instruments such as the pi nora, mong, and rebana, 
which can be used by instruments in a jazz ensemble as previously described. In addition to 
the previous compositional techniques, such as the utilization of Thai classical music 
compositional methods, or the employment of isan nuea melodies and its musical modes known 
as lai yai and lai sutsanaen combined with jazz improvisations and harmonies, as illustrated in 
Chapters 3 and 4, this compositional technique also allowed me to have more approaches to 
explore in my jazz hybridization orchestra project.

Exploring the Musical  
Components of  
dontri paknuea 
(Traditional Music of Northern Thailand) 
 
 
6.1 INTRODUCTION  
 
This chapter offers an overview of the traditional music of northern Thailand. I discuss 
practices from two regions of northern Thailand: the khap saw singing tradition of the 
northwest region, a region is predominantly influenced by practices of Chiang Mai province; 
and the salo and pin ensemble traditions of the northeast region, which are prominent in Nan 
province. I start by examining the northern Thai musical instruments used in both regions, and 
present several transcriptions to explore how these instruments can work in a jazz context. 
Next, I focus on the performance methods of the northern music tradition in my two examples. 
I analyze a khap saw performance from Chiang Mai province as well as two traditional songs 
performed by salo saw pin ensembles from Nan province. Like previous chapters, this chapter 
concludes with two musical examples of prototype compositions I have composed as examples 
of hybridized musicality between jazz and dontri paknuea.

THE TRADITIONAL MUSIC OF NORTHERN THAILAND (DONTRI 
PAKNUEA) 
 
The traditional music of northern Thailand, known as “Lanna Music,”276 is the musical practice 
of northern Thais who reside in the region’s mountain ranges and valleys, bordering Laos to 
the east and Myanmar to the west. Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Lampang, Lamphun, Mae Hong 
Son, Phayo, Phrea, Nan, and some regions of Uttaradit Province are among the nine provinces 
where traditional northern Thai music is still performed in modern-day Thailand.277 The 
prominent musical performances of this particular genre of traditional music can be divided 
into four different types278: 1) the practices of female and male singers (khap saw) accompanied 
by a musical ensemble of free-reed bamboo pipes (wong pi jum); 2) instrumental and 
accompanying music performed by northern string instruments in ensembles called salo, saw, 
and sueng in Chiang Mai (called salo, saw, and pin in Nan); 3) performances of klong sabat chai and 
klong luang drum ensembles for sacred and religious ceremonies, klong mong soeng drum 
ensembles for accompanying traditional northern dances (fon), and klong puje drum ensembles, 
which accompany the northern martial arts (fon dap); and lastly 4) the performances of pi phat 
Lanna musical ensembles (also known as pad, pad-gong, pad nae) which are slightly similar to pi 
phat ensembles of Thai classical music, but which employ different instruments, including 
drums called klong teng thing (กลองเต่งถึEง) and klong pong pong (กลองป่งโป้ง), as well as double-reed 
instruments known as nae luang (แนหลวง) and nae noi (แนน้อย). In addition, the traditional pi phat 
Lanna repertoire consists of both Thai classical compositions and compositions of northern 
Thailand.279 
 
                                                        
276 The word “Lanna” is also associated with other subjects—including the name of the ancient kingdom of the 
northern people, the primary influential language of northerners, and the historical period of the northern part of 
Thailand. Wyatt, Thailand: A Short History, 33. 
277 It is also important to recognize that these nine provinces were once part of the Lanna Kingdom, which was 
greatly influenced by the Lan Xang kingdom (Laos), in particular during the reign of King Setthathirah (1534-
1571), and were then ruled by Burmese during Toungoo and Konbaung dynasties from the 16th to the 18th 
centuries, before being officially annexed to Siam territory during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (1868-1910).

Rajabhat University, Matichon TV <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j-aDZ7gmRw> (27 July 2019). 
278 Lanna music is also referred to as Khon Mueang music in urban areas. In addition, there are multiple musical 
performances that belong to the hill tribes of northern Thailand. See, “The ethnic group research”, Princess Maha 
Chakri Sirindhorn Anthropology Centre’s website <https://www.sac.or.th/> and Benjamin Stuart Fairfield, “The

CHAPTER 6: Exploring the Musical Components of dontri paknuea 
 
 
143 
Among the several traditional music practices of these nine provinces, distinctive regional 
performances are also evident in terms of the utilization of different instruments, types of 
musical ensembles, and singing dialects. To enable easier understanding of this concept of 
regional distinction, Thai ethnomusicologists such as Pornprasit (2006) and Sumrongthong 
(2006) divide the musical practices of this region into two dominant groups: the traditional 
practices primarily influenced by Chiang Mai province (Northwest), and the musical cultures 
mainly inspired by Nan province (Northeast).280 Two practices, one from each province, lend 
themselves to the hybridization process of this project: 1) the traditional singing practice known 
as khap saw (from Chiang Mai Province), and 2) the instrumental compositions of salo and pin 
ensembles from Nan Province.  
 
6.2 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS  
 
Before providing a comprehensive discussion on the musical structures of northern Thai music 
that I have drawn on in this project, it is important to start by discussing the traditional 
instruments of this region relevant to this study, which can provide fundamental concepts of 
how northern Thai musicians perform music. These instruments include: 1) pi jum (bamboo 
pipe), 2) salo (two-stringed bowed fiddle), and 3) sueng or pin (plucked lute). 
 
PI JUM  
 
The word “pi jum” refers to the group of end-blown free reed bamboo pipe instruments (jum 
means “congregation” in Lanna dialect), consisting of five different sizes in pi jum ensembles. 
Each instrument has either six or seven finger holes. The individual instruments include pi koy 
(the main instrument, medium-sized), pi klang (for bass tones, medium-large), pi mae (for bass 
tones, the largest), pi lek (for treble tones, small), and pi tat (for treble tones, the smallest). Each 
instrument in this group of bamboo pipes is capable of producing seven relatively diatonic 
pitches similar to other bamboo instrument types used in Thai classical music or isan nuea music. 
The tuning system of the pi jum family appear to utilize the Western tuning system (sieng sakon) 
of the present-day,281 and it can be also divided into five categories based on the size of 
instruments, namely: 1) the pi koy system (in C), which starts from C(4)-D-E-F-G-A-B-C­

CHAPTER 6: Exploring the Musical Components of dontri paknuea 
 
 
144 
(within one octave); 2) the pi klang system (in C),  which starts from G(3)-A-B-C-D-E-F-G­; 
3) the pi lek system (in C), which is produced from G(4)-A-B-C-D-E-F-G­; 4) the pi mae in C, 
which is constructed from D(3)-E-F-G-A-B-C (only six holes, and hence rarely used); and 5) 
the pi tat system (in C), starting from C(5)-D-E-F-G-A-B-C­.   
 
When creating sound on pi jum instruments, pi jum players (chang pi in Lanna dialect) keep the 
entirety of the top of the pi jum, in which the instrument’s reed is implanted, in their mouths 
and use the four fingers of their right hand to cover four different holes, while applying the 
other three fingers of their left hand to cover three additional holes (i.e., 7 holes in total, except 
for the pi mae, which has six holes). In addition, when performing as a musical ensemble, to 
accompany vocalists (khap saw), this group of instruments is also capable of forming into three 
standard ensemble categories: 1) wong pi jum sam (three instruments), consisting of pi koy, pi 
klang, and pi lek; 2) wong pi jum si (four instruments), consisting of pi koy, pi klang, pi lek, and pi 
mae; and 3) wong pi jum ha (five instruments), including pi koy, pi klang, pi lek, pi mae, and pi tat. 
While performing together, pi jum ensembles are capable of producing a heterophonic texture 
based on idiomatic interpretations of the of the principal melodies, which is part of the unique 
and characteristic sound of northern Thai traditional music, which I explain later in this 
chapter. 
 
SALO 
 
The salo is a two-stringed fiddle that has historically been used by northern Thai musicians to 
generate the distinct characteristics and timbre of this style of music. The physical shape of the 
salo seems to be smaller than other fiddle instruments in the Thai classical ensemble, namely, 
the saw u, saw sam sai, and saw duang, and is consequently able to construct a brighter shining 
tone. There are three different salo sizes—large, medium, and small—and two different 
models282 that are distinctively employed in Chiang Mai and Nan Provinces, the regular salo 
(kom) and the salo kop. The difference in structure between these two models concern the size 
of the salo kop (use in Nan Province) (which is slightly bigger), and the barring of the “kop” on 
the instrument’s neck (similar to guitar frets). In contrast, the salo kom (employed in Chiang 
Mai Province) is a fretless instrument. The tuning concepts and systems of these two salo 
                                                        
282 I exclude another salo model—which has a similar playing technique to a regular salo but employs a different 
bow placement—that is only utilized in Uttaradit Province. 
",452,2793
161," 
CHAPTER 6: Exploring the Musical Components of dontri paknuea 
 
 
145 
models can be diverse, as with the tuning system of phin. However, there are currently three 
methods that are commonly used, including 1) the luk sam technique, which is frequently 
employed for a small type of salo kom and in which the higher string is tuned in the sound of 
G, and the lower string to the note of C note (perfect 5th). This is the opposite tuning to 2) 
the luk si technique in which the higher string is tuned to C and the lower string to G (perfect 
4th) (this is the preferred tuning for the medium-sized salo kom and salo kop type). Lastly, 3) in 
a combination of luk sam and luk si tuning techniques for a large salo kom, the strings are tuned 
in C(low)–G(mid)–C(high).283 This large salo kom—or salo sam sai (three strings)—exists, but is 
rarely used in traditional northern Thai musical ensembles these days. The style’s melodic 
embellishments that are comparable to those used in jazz compositions include sliding pitches 
(rud sai in Thai), trills (phrom niu) (พรมนิ%ว), and mordents (sabat niu). These elements are 
prominently employed in salo performances, with Terry Miller writing that, “Northern Thai 
music is distinguished by the use of certain instruments unique to the region, the extensive and 
distinctive ornamentation of melody, and the heterophonic texture of ensemble music.”284 
 
SUENG 
 
The sueng is another plucked lute instrument that is frequently employed in northern Thai 
traditional ensembles. On this instrument, the group of four stings—which are constructed in 
double courses, similar to the oud—is installed over the neck of the instrument. Nowadays, 
three different sizes and models of the sueng are widely performed, namely, sueng luang or sueng 
yai (the largest model, only used in some areas), the medium-sized sueng klang, and the small 
sueng lek.  These usually have a similar number of frets (nine in total), and are capable of 
producing different timbres, from the lower tones of the larger model to the brighter tones of 
the smaller model. Besides the differences in timbre, differences in the tuning of these models 
can also be observed; for example, the luk si technique (similar to the salo tuning system) is 
applied to the sueng yai and sueng lek (where the lower string is tuned in G, and the higher string 
in C), as well as the sueng klang and sueng luang. The name sueng can also refer to a related lute 
instrument called pin, which is played in Nan Province and is slightly larger, consisting of eleven 
to thirteen frets.

146 
Heavy tremolo techniques referred to as rua or mai dit khu (ไม้ดีดคู่) are frequently used in sueng 
performances in Lanna music, and can be interpreted as greatly contributing to the unique 
character of this style of traditional performance. The sueng’s primary function in northern Thai 
musical ensembles is to emphasize the main melodic patterns that are principally performed by 
the pi koy or salo, as well as to accommodate the stability of timing in the pi jum ensemble (in 
Chiang Mai Province). To provide a practical example, I have transcribed the sueng performance 
of a prominent multi-instrumentalist, Panupat Apichanatong from Chiang Mai Province, in a 
well-known northern Thai composition called “Saw Eue” (ซออือ).”285 Furthermore, Panupat is 
regarded as one of Thailand’s most outstanding contemporary Lanna musicians. His expertise 
in the construction of traditional Lanna instruments, particularly the sueng, was especially well-
known. Here, a set of eighth-note patterns with tremolo techniques frequently accent the 
upbeat, similar to performance on the phin, a small fretted lute from isan nuea, and other tremolo 
techniques are frequently employed throughout (Figure 6.1).286

6.3 PERFORMANCE METHODS  
 
KHAP SAW 
The musical performances of traditional northern Thai music are relatively old, and date back 
to the period of the Lanna Kingdom during the thirteenth century.287 Among the diverse

musical traditions that have preserved the sound of this period, I would like to focus on the 
traditional practice of khap saw performances, which include singing and pi jum. The phrase 
khap saw in Lanna means “singing” and can be easily confused with saw—which refers to a type 
of fiddle instrument in the central-Thai dialect. The original practices of khap saw performances 
and their poetic lyrics are significantly associated with historical events—in particular, wars 
between the Lanna Kingdom and their neighbors, which were written in Phongsawadan Lanna 
(chronicles); the Buddhist tales (Jataka story); stories of romantic courtship between 
northerners; or the ordinary stories of various ethnicities and hill tribes residing in the 
highlands, such as Tai yai (ไทใหญ่), Karen (กระเหรี.ยง), and Hmong (ม้ง). 
 
In the musical research of Bussakorn Sumrongthong, she explicitly categorizes khap saw 
performances into two different groups: 1) saw ruang (singing performances describing a long 
story) and 2) saw kio sao (ซอเกีEยวสาว)(spontaneous vocal performances by female and male singers 
that reveal romantic relationships).288 When generating the poetic lyrics—through either pre-
composed or improvised material—of khap saw performances, chang saw (vocalists) must strictly 
follow by a pattern of stanzas consisting of four lines with a length of six to twelve syllables. 
In addition, the melodic lines (thamnong) produced by singers must be musically synchronized 
with the melodic movements constructed by the pi jum ensembles, which practically function 
as the musical accompaniment to khap saw performances.   
 
Only a few types of melodic patterns (thamnong) are considered traditional Lanna compositions, 
and used as the principal melodies for accompanying khap saw performances, are still used 
today. These are: 1) the melodic patterns performed in the northwestern region, such as 
“Thamnong Tang Chiang Mai” (overture)(ตั%งเชียงใหม่), “Japu,” “Lamai,” “Eue, (อือ)” “Phama 
(พม่า),” and “Ngiew (เงี%ยว)”; 2) the regional melodic patterns prominently employed in the 
northeastern region, such as “Laplae (ลับแล)” and “Panfai” (used in northeast regions); and 3) 
“Long Nan (ล่องน่าน),” which is played in both the northeastern and northwestern regions.289   
To provide a practical example of the traditional melodic patterns (thamnong) in khap saw 
performances, I have transcribed the comprehensive treatment of the melodic patterns in 
“Thamnong Ngiew” as performed by Inchan Muncharoen, a player of the pi koy (an instrument

is also a member of the Lanna khap saw Artists’ Association, which is endowed by the Thai 
Ministry of Culture (Figure 6.2).290

pitches are circled in red. 
 
By transcribing Inchan Muncharoen’s rendition of “Thamnong ngiew,” I perceived that this 
particular traditional melodic pattern was in a scale resembling A natural minor. The utilization 
of repetitive notes—in particular, A-A, and D-D (in the red circles)—can also be frequently 
observed in this transcription. Repetitive interval patterns are also frequently constructed in 
downward minor-third intervals (e.g., G-E, C-A), upward minor-third intervals (e.g., A-C, E-

G), and upward major-second intervals (e.g., A-B, G-A, D-E). These patterns help to create 
the intervallic characteristics of this composition’s melodic movements. It is also noticeable 
that the melodic contour of “Thamnong ngiew” tends to be in skip-wise motion when 
compared to the lyrical type of Thai classical music that tends to be in stepwise motion. 
Surprisingly, the note B—which is not considered part of the structure of the A minor 
pentatonic scale—also frequently appears, providing a contrast to the sound of penta-centric 
ideas common in Thai classical music and traditional northeastern isan nuea music. 
 
Another striking musical element discovered in the transcription process concerns the 
application of perpetual eighth-note rhythms, which is evident throughout the transcription. 
This rhythmic performance method is considered to be one of the key features of performance 
on the pi koy and other instruments from the pi jum family. Because pi koy players perform this 
instrument by holding the top of the instrument in their mouths constantly and relying on 
circular breathing, they are capable of performing perpetual rhythmic patterns without taking 
a breath or needing to stop for breathing. In addition, the use of the melodic embellishments 
widely demonstrated in this transcription play a crucial role in creating the individual character 
of pi koy performances—especially in the blending of pitches in both downward and upward 
motions and the application of trill techniques called phrom niu (พรมนิ%ว). Inchan Muncharoen has 
applied these elements in multiple areas of his performance to produce the characteristic sound 
of pi jum. 
 
Unlike southeastern rong ngeng and isan nuea, where homophonic textures are used, the musical 
texture of khap saw performances appears to be heterophony, with a variety of instrument 
configurations performing variations of fundamental melodic lines. Of the numerous pi jum 
ensembles, three main types are frequently employed in khap saw of the northwestern region. 
The first type of accompanying ensemble is known as wong pi jum sam (three instruments) and 
consists of a pi koy, pi krang, pi lek, sueng, and a male and female vocalist. The second type, which 
is used in a modern setting, is wong pi jum si (four instruments), and includes a pi koy, pi krang, pi 
lek, pi mae or sueng, as well as a male and female vocalist. The third model of ensemble is the 
wong pi jum ha (five instruments), and consists of a pi koy, pi krang, pi lek, pi mae, pi tat, and a male 
and female vocalist. In contrast, in the northeastern area, only one setup is widely observed for 
accompanying khap saw performances—wong salo saw pin, which consists of one salo kop (fret

fiddle), one or two pin (lute), and a male and female vocalist.291 To demonstrate a practical 
example of the heterophonic texture of khap saw performances, I have included an illustration 
from Keng Watcharin’s instructional video of khap saw performances meant as a resource for 
khap saw studies to provide a practical example of the musical texture of khap saw performances. 
This piece “Thamnong Japu,” is performed by a wong pi jum si (four instruments) ensemble led 
by Unruean Hongtong, a senior traditional musician from Chang Mai Province (Figure 6.3). 292

of the perpetual rhythm of the principal melodies, played by pi koy. These melodies must be 
related to the instruments’ ranges and typically approach the final pitches of the musical phrases 
as displayed in m. 7, 11, 16, 20, 24, and 28 (red rectangles) in order to create the heterophonic 
texture of traditional northern music. 
 
This performance is an example of how the pi jum ensemble—which includes the pi koy, pi 
klang, pi lek, and pi mae––typically functions. The pi koy plays a short introductory solo from 
mm.1-4, and the other instruments simultaneously enter on the second beat of m.4. And, 
similar to the plae thamnong technique applied by Thai classical musicians, each musical phrase 
has a target pitch for all the players, which they must coordinate with the mandatory pitch 
provided by the pi koy player. This musical interpretation of the principal melodies is called the 
or kae (ออกแก) technique in the northern Thai dialect. 
 
Another interesting aspect of this transcription is the use of octave unison, which is shown in 
the rectangle labeled #1. This performance style, which is based on pi koy melodies, can be 
applied to other pi instruments, as seen in mm.12-14 and m.17. Importantly, the instrumental 
ranges of wong pi jum play an important role in constructing the musical textures of 
this performance, ranging from pi koy (main melody), pi lek (soprano), pi klang (tenor), and pi 
mae (bass). I apply these to my writing for saxophone soli. 
 
One of the prominent rhythmic characteristics of pi jum performances concerns the application 
of musical accents in the second and the fourth beats, which are somewhat similar to the 
musical accents applied in sueng and isan nuea performance and the rhythm of jazz. This 
rhythmic technique is a consequence of the circular breathing method of pi jum players, in 
particular, their consecutive breaths executed rhythmically. This technique is also known as hom 
lom (ห่มลม) in the northern dialect. Furthermore, the melodic construction of “Thamnong Japu” 
appears to be in disjunct motion, with large intervals extending over the third interval regularly 
played in a set of perpetual eighth-note rhythms, which significantly produced the fundamental 
characteristics of a pi jum performance (khap saw). Please note the vocal sound produced by the 
interaction between a male and female vocalist, and that singing from northern poetry is also 
performed in coordination with the instruments’ sounds.

SALO PIN 
 
Another type of musical ensemble used to accompany khap saw performances, and that can 
also be performed as an instrumental ensemble in the northeastern region (in particular in Nan 
Province) is the wong salo (saw) pin ensemble. This particular ensemble consists of two types of 
instruments and, sometimes, vocalists: one salo kop, two pin (lute-type instruments), and one 
male and one female vocalist—if performing in a singing context. One of the prominent 
characteristics produced by this musical ensemble is the salo kop’s bright and gleaming timbre, 
which is produced by its steel strings. Another prominent characteristic is the effect of the 
perpetual rhythms of the principal melodies, mainly as eighth notes. This is musically reinforced 
by the sound of two wooden lute instruments (pin), which contribute significantly to the 
sophisticated heterophonic texture of salo pin performances. Nowadays, several traditional 
northern compositions which have prefixed titles referring to “Saw” in the Lanna dialect are 
still frequently performed, such as 1) “Saw Long Nan,” 2) “Saw Laplae (ซอ ลับแล),” 3) “Saw 
Panfai,” 4) “Saw Dan Nan,” and 5) “Saw Phra Lo Doen Dong, (ซอ พระลอเดินดง).”  
 
To better understand the structure of the melodic structures of salo pin compositions, I decided 
to transcribe two compositions—“Saw Dan Nan” and “Saw Panfai”—which I will discuss 
briefly and use in my compositional prototypes. These selected transcriptions (“Saw Dan 
Nan”293 and “Saw Pan Fai were performed by Wiset Kaewsriwong, a native musician from Nan 
Province and a member of the Lanna khap saw Artists’ Association from Nan Province (Figures 
6.4. and 6.5).294

“Saw Dan Nan” is performed by salo kop. In contrast to other Thai musical traditions that were 
transcribed in the research, the construction of the melodic movement of this composition is 
based on a scale comparable to B♭ Dorian, with the majority of the accented beats approaching 
the pitch B♭. G natural can also be observable in multiple locations, providing the characteristic 
Dorian sound. Similar to the “Thamnong Japu,” the majority of the melodic material in “Saw

CHAPTER 6: Exploring the Musical Components of dontri paknuea 
 
 
154 
Dan Nan” appears to be in disjunct motion, with large intervals such as perfect fourths and 
fifths being seen in various places. 
 
The six striking melodic patterns that musically contribute to the characteristic sound of the 
salo pin composition have also been indicated by the different numbers, consisting of the 
following melodic patterns:  
 
1) 2 - 4 - 1- 4 - ♭7- 5 - 4 - 2 
2) 2 - ♭7 - 1- 2 -1  
3) 2 - ♭7 - 1 - 5 - ♭7 - 4 - 2 -1 
4) 6 - 1 - 2 - 6 - 1  
5) 2 - 6 - 1 - 5 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 1 - 4  
6) 4 - 6 - 5 - 6 - 1 - 2 - 6 -1  
 
I utilize these patterns to compose and imitate the sound of salo pin compositions in a similar 
manner to jazz musicians’ application of jazz licks for improvisation, as I will discuss later. This 
piece also includes another striking technique—the blending of pitches and trills––which is 
capable of being executed with Western instruments in musical hybridity compositions seeking 
to interpret and musically express the unique sound of the salo kop performance. 
 
The “Saw Pan Fai” composition is also one of the most famous compositional pieces in the 
salo pin repertoire, and is widely employed both as instrumental music and for accompanying 
vocals. In this specific version, the melodic movements of the “Saw Pan Fai,” which was played 
by salo kop, are based on an A major pentatonic scale, with the majority of the target notes of 
each musical phrase directly approaching the root note. In addition, the fifth E, and the second 
note B are also employed as target notes, as noted in m.7, 12, 22, and 24. In contrast to “Saw 
Dan Nan,” the melodic movements of “Saw Pan Fai” are prominently repetitive and based on 
a twenty-four-bar phrase. (The second repetition of the melody begins in m.25.) 
 
The memorable melodic patterns of the characteristic sound of northern traditional music that 
feature in this particular piece include: 
 
1) 2 - 3 - 5 - 5 - 6 - 1 - 3 - 2 - 1  
",378,2006

5) 1 - 6 - 5 - 3 - 5 
6) 6 - 5 - 6 - 1- 5 
 
I apply these patterns to construct northern Thai melodic lines in my own compositions, 
intermingled with jazz harmonies.

6.4 PRELIMINARY COMPOSITIONS                                                                                                      
 
To illustrate the prototypes of musical hybridization compositions that integrate musical 
elements of northern Thai music, I have divided the relevant compositional techniques into 
two comprehensive models. I first have attempted to construct a concise saxophone soli 
section by adapting the melodic movements of the pi jum ensemble from the previous 
illustration. In this soli section, the lead part—located in the soprano saxophone—was created 
by utilizing the previously obtained melodic movement of the pi lek (the smallest model). 
Thereafter, the second alto and the first and second tenor soli lines were adapted and 
",197,1195
172," 
CHAPTER 6: Exploring the Musical Components of dontri paknuea 
 
 
156 
constructed based on the melodic movements of the pi koy, pi klang, and pi mae obtained from 
the same transcription. Lastly, I partly applied the four-part double-lead technique that is 
frequently employed in saxophone soli writings to the baritone saxophone part. In this baritone 
saxophone part, the instrument performs one or two octaves below the lead part provided by 
the soprano saxophone. As a consequence, this saxophone soli is capable of producing a 
version of the characteristic sound of northern Thai music by using jazz orchestra instruments 
and their corresponding conventional techniques (Figure 6.6).  
 
 
Figure 6.6: Saxophone soli inspired by pi jum. 
 
In a second musical hybridization compositional example, I composed a contemporary jazz 
composition entitled “Phumin” by integrating the five melodic patterns of two traditional 
compositions, namely “Saw Dan Nan” and “Saw Pan Fai” (Figure 6.7). Similar to the 
",150,1016
173," 
CHAPTER 6: Exploring the Musical Components of dontri paknuea 
 
 
157 
compositional methods of producing preliminary jazz compositions in Thai classical music, the 
melodic patterns obtained from my previous musical analyses have also been practically applied 
to the principal melodic patterns of “Phumin.” These selected patterns—1) 1-6-2-1-6-1-5, 3, 
2) 2-3-5-5-6-1-3-2-1, and 3) 1-6-2-1-6-1-5—from the “Saw Pan Fai” composition, were 
transposed to the key of E♭ major and rhythmically adjusted as the main melody in the B 
section of this composition. These adapted melodies were performed by the double bass (in 
red rectangles in Figure 6.7a), in oblique motion and in syncopation with the piano’s sustained 
sounds on E♭. I attempt, in this technique of interaction with the bass melodies, to depict the 
atmosphere of mountain ranges and valleys of the northern region. For the melodic patterns 
acquired through the transcription process of “Saw Dad Nan,” I also manipulated the patterns 
of 1) 2-4-1-4-♭7-5-4-2 and 2) 2-6-1-5-6-5-4-1-4 by transposing them to the E♭ Dorian mode. I 
also adjusted and extended their rhythms to suit time signatures such as 6/4 and 5/4, as also 
illustrated in rectangles in the D section. Ultimately, I chose to construct my own melody 
combined with the adopted melodic patterns in a disjunct motion to create the original 
melodies of “Phumin,” which, in my view, provides the characteristic sound of northern 
traditional Thai music. 295

6.5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
 
The musical practice of northern Thailand, commonly known as Lanna music, is separated into 
two categories: 1) traditional practices primarily influenced by Chiang Mai province 
(northwest), and 2) musical traditions primarily inspired by Nan province (northeast). The 
major distinction between these locations can be found in the use of different instruments, 
such as salo and salo kop, or in the names of musical groups, such as salo, saw, and sueng ensembles 
(northwest) and salo, saw, pin ensembles (northeast). Pi jum is a crucial instrument in this region’s 
northwest musical tradition, and it may be paired with other instruments from the pi family and 
performed as wong pi jum for khap saw performances. Pi jum’s melodic lines are based on disjunct 
motions that combine several interval patterns, such as ascending and descending minor third 
intervals, which emphasize intervallic qualities rather stepwise motion, shown in Thai classical 
music’s lyrical composition type. Other technical methods, like bending and trills, are also used 
to offer this instrument a particular character. Importantly, pi jum is also constantly performed 
in eighth-note rhythm, which is the result of hom lom techniques. Furthermore, as demonstrated 
in the preliminary compositional process, the melodic lines of pi jum ensemble, which create 
from three to five instruments, are capable of adapting to the woodwind section of a jazz 
orchestra.  
 
Unlike the northwest, the northeast’s khap saw performance used a wong salo (saw) pin ensemble 
to accompany vocalists rather than a wong pi jum. The previous transcriptions of the wong salo, 
",267,1788

CHAPTER 6: Exploring the Musical Components of dontri paknuea 
 
 
159 
saw, and pin ensembles also yielded remarkable melodic patterns that can be used in place of 
jazz licks to create the distinctive sound of salo pin compositions. When compared to other 
Thai instruments, the bright sound of salo kop and its fretboard can make it easier to transcribe. 
As opposed to isan nuea melodies, which rely on the penta-centric concept, the melodic 
structure of northern Thai music can be formed from natural minor or Dorian scales, with the 
sound of 2nd and 6th degrees, heard in its melodic movement as demonstrated in “Thamnong 
ngiew” and “Saw Dan Nan.” This can help jazz composers, and others interested in working 
with Thai music traditions to realize that not all music traditions of Thailand are grounded on 
the penta-centric concept. Performances of rong ngeng and lanna music are among the 
exceptions. Interestingly, the use of sliding and trills, which are widely used in northern music 
performances can also be imitated by western instruments in jazz orchestra, such as flute and 
clarinet to emphasize the musical features of northern music performances. 
 
In Chapters 3 to 6, I examined key musical aspects of Thai musical traditions in order to 
develop a better appreciation of how Thai music functions, as well as composing a preliminary 
or prototype piece drawing on transcriptions of Thai music and experimentally incorporating 
jazz musical elements as a case study for myself and other jazz composers who might be 
interested in this music. As stated in the research methodology section, understanding of the 
key musical features of these traditions emerges from the concept of learning music by ear 
through the transcribing process and a review of relevant works in Thai music studies. As a 
result, these four chapters have provided critical insights into Thai musical traditions, a crucial 
step before I began producing the key creative outcomes for this research. The musical aspects 
that I have selected interact well with the musical characteristics of contemporary jazz. They 
can also incorporate other Thai music features that I engaged with in my process of composing 
larger-scale works for jazz orchestra, which I explain in detail in the following chapter.

Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
My ambition is to create opportunities to praise beauty using music in a Thai tradition and style. In my 
own musical identity, I want to create something thought-provoking and modern that is in line with the 
wisdom of Thai philosophy. I’m doing this for the sake of Thai society and for the benefit rest of the 
world.296

7.1 INTRODUCTION  
 
This chapter provides a commentary on my composition work, which constitutes seven 
contemporary jazz orchestra pieces totaling 67 minutes that have musically integrated Thai 
musical traditions from three different regions, as well as from Thai classical music. It is divided 
into four sections. The first section discusses four compositions inspired by Thai classical 
music. “Buang-Suang” (“Deity Worship”) is a piece of ritual and worship music that pays 
respect to the music gods, the great teachers, and the three gems of Buddhism; “Phuen Ban” 
(“Village Song”) is a conventional big-band composition inspired by the character of traditional 
Thai penta-centric melodies; “Samniang Jin” (“Porcelain”) is a contemporary jazz piece that 
adopts a transcultural Thai-Chinese musical idiom; and “Patchim” (“Epilogue”) is a farewell 
composition inspired by the traditional practices of Thai classical music. My commentary on

these four compositions primarily focuses on the musical elements of Thai classical music that 
I have infused, and transformed, into music for jazz orchestra.  
 
The three subsequent sections each focus on one composition. These three compositions, 
which are influenced by regional traditional Thai music, are: “Mekong” (“River of Souls”), an 
interpretation of music of northeastern Thailand (isan nuea); “Singora” (“Dance of Kinnari”), a 
contemporary jazz orchestral piece that illustrates the multicultural practices of southern 
Thailand, where the music cultures of Thai Buddhists (nora) and Muslims (rong ngeng) have 
interacted with each other; and “Wiang Haeng” (“The Northern Rhapsody”), a contemporary 
jazz composition inspired by the performance practices of traditional northern Thai music 
(khap saw and sueng). Unlike the previous four compositions that were inspired by Thai classical 
music, I undertake a comprehensive musical analysis of these three compositions not only to 
demonstrate the level of musical integration of regional Thai musical elements, but also to 
highlight the level of complexity of the jazz compositional techniques that I utilized to create 
these pieces.  
 
The musical elements of the Thai music traditions employed to create jazz orchestral works 
and applied in my commentary on these compositions are divided into two separate categories. 
The first group consists of musical elements that I learned throughout my research on Thai 
musical traditions, as well as the transcribing process discussed in previous chapters, and of 
new elements based on what I discovered during the compositional processes of the jazz 
orchestra project and further transcriptions of mine, which are discussed in this chapter. I then 
employed these musical elements to create sketch scores of my initial ideas before expanding 
them into full jazz orchestra compositions. The second category includes musical elements I 
encountered in my archival research on four books containing Thai musical manuscripts that 
I discovered when visiting Thailand in 2019. These books are: Collected Works of the Thai Classical 
Repertoire Vol. 4, and 6 by Panya Roongruang297—which were originally published by The Thai 
Music Manuscript Committee from 1930 to 1932, and 1936 to 1942 respectively; and Thai Music 
Manuscript Vol. 1, and Vol. 3,298 which were first published by the Thai Fine Arts Department. 
I spent a significant amount of time learning to play transcriptions obtained from the four

books on the piano to assimilate these musical influences and try to find practical ways of 
integrating and blending these transcriptions into my original compositions.  
 
Of the many possibilities for an analytical methodology in my discussion of my work, I adopted 
the framework of Rayburn Wright’s musical analysis in Inside the Score (1982), Richard Lawn’s 
Jazz Scores and Analysis (2018), and Bill Dobbins’s Composing and Arranging for the Contemporary Big 
Band (2014)—all of which are broadly accepted within jazz composition studies. The benefit 
of employing these structures of musical analysis is that they assist jazz composers in 
revealing—and discussing––the orchestration, harmonization, vocal techniques, form, solo 
background parts, balance, and other important compositional techniques used in jazz 
orchestra compositions. To adhere to these frameworks, my commentary in this chapter will 
begin with general observations on the various compositional approaches—including artistic 
inspirations, melody, harmony, and rhythm—before providing a comprehensive analysis of 
specific writing techniques, and then addressing in detail the elements of Thai music that I have 
included, transformed, and infused into the pieces. (Appendix D contains the seven scores for 
my portfolio of jazz orchestra compositions.) 
 
7.1 COMPOSITIONS INSPIRED BY THAI CLASSICAL MUSIC  
 
“BUANG-SUANG” (“DEITY WORSHIP”) 
 
“Buang-Suang” (“Deity Worship”) is a jazz orchestra composition inspired by “Psalm,” the 
final movement of John Coltrane’s album, A Love Supreme (1965), which Coltrane described as 
his spiritual proclamation of faith in God.299 Similarly, in the wai khru tradition, Thai classical 
musicians also perform a specific music repertoire (phleng naphat) to invite all deities and to pay 
homage to their teachers during the ceremony. Inspired by both A Love Supreme and the wai 
khru tradition, my intention in composing this piece was for it to serve as a musical devotion 
that intertwined my faith in the gods of music as well as an overture for this project. Through 
the sound of a jazz orchestra, I also intended for it to pay homage to all Thai musical masters. 
                                                        
299 Coltrane’s improvisation on “Psalm” reveals that his sax solo is a wordless “recitation” of the poem he included 
in the liner notes to A Love Supreme, with one note for each syllable. Each section of several lines has an arch 
shape—an ascending phrase, a recitation on one tone, and a descending phrase. The recitation tones ascend as 
the piece builds in intensity. Coltrane’s poem is punctuated with the frequently recurring words “Thank You, 
God.” At the final word of the poem, “Amen,” he clearly plays “Amen” on his sax. Coltrane adds a flourish only 
on that final word. See, Lewis Porter, John Coltrane His Life and Music (University Michigan Press, 1999), 244-249.

The melodies of this composition are divided into two sections, one carrying original melodic 
lines and the other containing melodic adaptations taken from the thang khong wong yai and ranad 
ek of two classical music compositions employed in the wai khru ritual, namely, “Sathukan” and 
“Sathukan Klong.” (See Roongruang, Collected Works of the Thai Classical Repertoire Vol.6 for 
notation of these compositions.) The harmony of “Buang-Suang” features suspended chords, 
which were played by McCoy Tyner, as can be heard in Coltrane’s “Psalm.” Throughout the 
composition, extended chords, such as 9sus, minor 11th, and major13th can be also observed. 
 
Unlike “Psalm”—in which Coltrane’s tenor saxophone improvisation assumes a primary 
role—the solo section of “Buang-Suang” features solos by trumpet, soprano saxophone, and 
bass clarinet. Several drum solos also add complex ideas from a rhythmic improvisational 
perspective. Two rhythmic styles, namely, swing and slow processional drumbeats, which were 
inspired by Elvin Jones’s drumming in “Psalm,” constitute the fundamental rhythmic ideas of 
this composition. The total duration of this composition is nine minutes and fifty-seven 
seconds, which is represented by the letters A-G in the graphic below.

COMPOSITIONAL DISCUSSIONS  
 
My initial intention in composing the A section of “Buang-Suang” was to imitate John 
Coltrane’s “Psalm.” To do so, I composed thematic melodies that seemed to convey similar 
emotions to “Psalm,” enhancing and elevating the mood of listeners in a spiritual sense. I 
constructed these melodies from various motifs in quarter-note triplets performed by two alto 
saxophones, soprano saxophone, and flugelhorn. I then created the improvisational section for 
the trumpet and drums (using mallets in a manner reminiscent of Elvin Jones’s drumming), in 
order to contribute further emotional improvisations that interact with the melodies in a similar 
way to the “Psalm” recording. To express the sound of Thai ceremonial music, I adopted the 
thang khong wong yai of the “Sathukan”300 (See Roongruang, Collected Works of the Thai Classical 
Repertoire Vol. 6, p. 126 in mm. 1-10), which is considered the most fundamental piece in Thai 
music, according to Panya Roongruang’s musical manuscripts. I later adjusted these melodic 
lines obtained from the manuscripts to unify the motifs in the melodies I composed, and also 
modified certain notes in order to align them with the harmonies I composed (see Figure 7.1). 
                                                        
300 The “Sathukan” is the first composition that Thai musicians must learn before attending a wai khru ceremony. 
The composer of this composition is anonymous, yet the distinct variations can be observed in different Thai 
music teachers. The version that I have used for my musical adaptation was transcribed by the Thai Music 
Manuscript Committee. For more, see: Roongruang, “Thai Classical Music Its Movement from Oral to Written 
Transmission,” 229-253.

composed, the harmony, the drum part using mallets, and the reference to thang khong

For the second thematic melody, located in the C section, I composed a melody for a female 
vocalist to perform using scat singing techniques to deliver the impression of serenity. I then 
integrated the rhythmic patterns of Buddhist plainchant, which is similar to Coltrane’s 
improvisation that is understood to be his prayer to God. As illustrated in Figure 7.2, I have 
composed the specific melodic lines for the trombone (m.73-m.78) and bass clarinet that were

then laid over the fundamental melodies sung by a vocalist. This particular melody also 
synchronizes with the rhythmic patterns of the Buddhist chant known as “Salutation of the 
Triple Gem” which is performed before the start of the wai khru ceremony. Additionally, in 
line with Coltrane’s approach, the number of syllables in this particular chant (18) is equal to 
the number of pitches in the trombone melody, as depicted here:

In addition to my melodic adaptation of the thang khong wong yai from “Sathukan,” I also 
employed the fundamental melodic lines (thang khong wong yai) from “Sathukan Klong”—

another sacred composition from the wai khru ceremony. My version of this thang khong wong is 
also based on the version in Panya’s manuscripts, and is present in the electric piano part from 
the D to E sections. (For the original melodic lines of this thang khong wong yai, see Roongruang, 
Collected Works of the Thai Classical Repertoire Vol 6., p. 130-140 in mm.1-5 and mm.10-16.) Similar 
to how I used the thang khong wong yai of the Sathukan in the A section, these selected melodic 
lines omit the pitch B from the original melodies in order to be appropriately used within the 
harmonic design of this composition. (See also Roongruang, Collected Works of the Thai Classical 
Repertoire Vol.6, p. 126, mm.23-27, as well as mm.36-42.) Furthermore, these particular lines are 
performed along with background parts in the brass section, and also interact with the soloist, 
who improvises around these two particular sections. Figure 7.3 and Figure 7.4 illustrate the 
melodic adaptation of the thang khong wong yai in the electric piano parts of the D and E sections. 
The former is obtained from the thang khong wong yai of “Sathukan Klong,” while the latter is 
thang khong wong of “Sathukan.”

I also applied the rhythmic patterns of nathap song mai song chan from Chapter 3 to emphasize 
the Thai classical rhythmic characteristics in “Buang-Suang.” This is played by the bass player 
from mm.120-124 in the E section (Figure 7.5). 
 
Figure 7.5: Excerpt from “Buang-Suang” bass part (mm. 120–124), illustrating the 
rhythmic application of nathap song mai song chan. 
 
Another important Thai classical musical element employed in “Buang-Suang” is the imitation 
of the ti kep instrumental technique of the ranad ek (thang ranad ek). This particular technique, 
which is a sequence of eighths notes produced by ranad ek to interpret luk thong, is usually 
employed in plae thamnong, as described in Chapter 3. I created multiple eighth-note patterns 
for the vocal, organ, and guitar parts, all of which are performed using the ti kep technique, as 
demonstrated in Figure 7.6 (m.143-m.146). However, to provide more varied rhythmic ideas, 
I also adjusted this particular melodic pattern to be performed in triplets or sixteenth note 
patterns, in order to increase the emotional intensity. When performed, these melodic patterns 
interact with the improvisations of the lead alto and background vocals created from various 
extended chords, which also feature in this dense climax section.

“PHUEN BAN” (“VILLAGE SONG”) 
 
My intention in composing “Phuen Ban” was to create a jazz orchestra piece in Duke 
Ellington’s big-band style, based on the penta-centric concept—one of the significant 
characteristics of Thai classical music. This work was inspired by one of my students in 
Thailand, who shared his discontent on social media during the recent political turmoil in the 
country, writing: “What I had been taught in a jazz history class is that this music has been 
strongly associated with freedom of expression, democracy, and civil rights movements, but 
why do Thai jazz musicians only use this music for one purpose, which is to serve rich people?” 
As a result, I would like to devote this jazz orchestra piece to my fellow colleagues in the lower-
middle class and hope that this composition will be used as a musical tool to promote a sense 
of social equality in Thailand. I also believe that jazz in Thailand will someday become more 
associated with the social-cultural practices of all Thai people, rather than as a genre for one 
specific part of society. 
 
The fundamental melodic lines of “Phuen Ban” are the product of thematic development that 
starts with a simple melodic pattern. As the piece progresses, this thematic melody becomes 
more developed, before reaching its climax in several sections of this composition. I have also 
adapted elements of three other Thai classical works—“Khmen Liep Nakhon (เขมรเลียบนคร),” 
“Khmen Phuang (เขมรพวง),” and “Saen Kham Nung,”302 all composed by Luang Pradit Pairoh 
(Son Silpabanleng)––to my melodic lines in multiple places. 
 
The harmonic rhythm of “Phuen Ban” has been designed to suit the characteristic sound of a 
traditional jazz orchestra, which features functional harmony. The key centers are A major and 
E♭ major, which have been used to construct standard chord progressions (e.g., ii7 V7 Imaj7 or I 
IV7 ii7 V7). The two main solos in the improvisation section are on piano and soprano 
saxophone. Trumpet with plunger mute, trombone, and clarinet ad-lib solos, all referencing 
Ellington’s jazz orchestral style, can also be heard several times throughout this work. 
 
Unlike other compositions in this project, the rhythm of “Phuen Ban” is centered on heavy-
swing and ragtime grooves. In contrast to the rigidity of medium-swing tempo in 4/4, I use a 
                                                        
302 “Saen Kham Nung” (A Hundred Thousand Sorrows) was also written by Luang Pradit Pairoh to express 
discontent with the musical reforms of the government of Prime Minister Plaek Phibulsongkhram. Wong, Sounding

COMPOSITIONAL DISCUSSIONS 
 
My purpose in composing “Phuen Ban” was to establish a Thai folk-melody of sorts based on 
the penta-centric concept as described by Phichit Chaisaree. The three initial thematic melodies 
include Melody A (mm.21- 29), A2 (mm. 30–38), B (mm.39-46), and C (mm.47- 59), all of 
which have primarily been constructed in the A major pentatonic scale (Figure 7.7). 
Compositional techniques such as call-and-response and melodic variation also serve to 
construct melody A2, which is a slight variation of melody A. In contrast to melodies A and 
A2, however, the melodic patterns of B and C are more complex, involving a dense rhythmic 
pattern and providing less pentatonic sounds in order to avoid uninteresting ideas generated 
from the repetition of melodies A and A2; B and C are also performed in medium swing. The 
concluding statement of the first melodic section, which is based on the chromaticism concepts

174 
typical in conventional jazz orchestra writing, occurs in mm.55-59, with a particular melodic 
movement audible in multiple places to generate memorable impressions to the listener. 
 
Figure 7.7:  The first thematic melodies of “Phuen Ban”: A (mm.21- 29), A2 (mm. 30–
38), B (mm.39-46), and C (mm.47- 59). 
 
To emphasize the integration of traditional Thai music elements with swing, I composed a 
written solo for the piano. This particular piano part imitates one of the performance styles of 
",85,558

CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
175 
ranad ek, a solo piece called thang dio ranad ek.303 As described in Chapter 3, to perform thang dio 
ranad ek, Thai musicians deploy specific techniques, including rua (a single melodic pitch 
tremolo), kro (two-pitch tremolo), sabat (grace notes), and khayi (sixteenth notes of idiomatic 
improvisation). I applied these techniques in the piano solo mimicking thang dio ranad ek (Figure 
7.8). 
 
Figure 7.8: Piano solo from “Phuen Ban” mimicking thang dio ranad ek. (mm. 109, 110, 
and 128 for sabat; mm. 113-115 for rua; mm. 119 - 120 for kro; and mm. 124-127 for khayi.) 
 
In addition, I created a trumpet soli passage—a characteristic of traditional jazz orchestra 
composition—to add more Thai musical influences in the context of a swing feel. The total 
duration of this trumpet soli section is 16 measures, and it is primarily constructed in the B-
                                                        
303 “Thang dio” is used to indicate a solo piece. It can also be applied to other instruments. For example, a solo 
performance in khong wong is called “thang dio khong wong yai.”

major pentatonic scale (A♯ is used as a passing tone or for harmonizing purposes), which 
emphasizes the soli’s Thai musical character and provides tension in relation to the voicings 
of, in the piece’s main key center of A major, the 9th (B), ♯11 (D♯), and 13 (F♯). Two trumpets 
with harmon mutes and two trumpets with cup mutes play this particular passage, in a timbre 
combination also commonly featured in Duke Ellington’s compositions for jazz orchestra 
(Figure 7.9).  
 
 
Figure 7.9: Trumpet soli from “Phuen Ban” mm.236-240. 
 
In composing “Phuen Ban,” similarly to in my compositional process for “Buang-Suang,” I 
adopted the fundamental melody of “Khmer Liep Nakhon,” which may awake a sense of 
recognition in a Thai audience. This particular melodic line was composed by Luang Pradit 
Pairoh (Son Silpabanleng) and was also adapted from another composition, namely “Khmer 
Khao Khio” (song chan), a Thai classical music piece in the Khmer accent written by an 
anonymous composer—as noted by Montri Tramote in the Thai Music Book Vol. 1.304 To 
transform this and other melodies to work with my composition, I employed jazz arranging 
techniques such as melodic augmentation and diminution as well as, in this example, key 
transposition from Khmer Liep Nakhon’s original key of C major to A major. I included these 
melodic lines in the vibraphone part, which imitates the sound of the ranad ek, playing 
contrapuntal melodic lines in contrast to the original melody played by the woodwind and brass 
sections (Figure 7.10). (For the original “Khmer Liep Nakhon” melody, see Tramote, Thai 
Music Manuscript Vol. 1, p. 91)

I also adopt the melody of “Khmer Phuang,” a Thai classical music piece in the Thai-Khmer 
accent composed by Luang Pradit Pairoh (Son Silpabanleng), as a solo in the transitional 
section in mm.221-231. The process of adapting this particular melody was similar to my 
adaptation of “Khmer Liep Nakhon,” with augmentation, diminution, and key transposition 
from the original key of “Khmer Phuang” all prominent. These arranged melodic lines were 
assigned to the lead trombone part to be performed with a plunger mute to imitate one of the 
musical features of the trombone section in Ellington’s jazz orchestra, which often saw the use 
of the plunger mute (Figure 7.11). (See Tramote, Thai Music Manuscript Vol. 1, p.99 for the 
original melody of “Khmer Phuang.”)

Lastly, in the climactic section of “Phuen Ban” (Figure 7.12), I have also included elements of 
my transcription of “Saen Kham Nung” by Luang Pradit Pairoh (Son Silpabanleng) from 
Chapter 3 to function as a thematic melody. I have modified and implemented this melodic 
line for the vocal and vibraphone parts (mm.273-276), which are performed in combination 
with my original melodies in the woodwind section, as well as accompanied by rhythms of the 
stride piano style, another typical element of Ellington’s performances.

modified “Saen Kham Nung” melody in the vocal and vibraphone, as well as my

 “SAMNIANG JIN” (“PORCELAIN”) 
 
“Samniang Jin” is a jazz orchestra work that expresses the musical influence of Chinese music 
on the Thai classical music repertoire—specifically, music belonging to the phleng samniang jin 
category. As noted earlier, Terry E. Miller’s evidence of the cultural influence that Chinese 
music had on Thai classical music, including the adoption of Chinese instruments and melodies 
in the sometimes stereotypical “Chinese accent.”305 The melodies of “Samniang Jin” are based

my childhood memories of growing up in a Thai southern-Chinese household. These

than two independent, simultaneous melodic lines to imitate a polyphonic stratification 
texture—one of the characteristics of Thai classical music identified by David Morton. In 
addition, I also employ thang ranad thum and thang ranad ek from “Choed Jin (เชิดจีน),”306 a Thai 
classical composition by Pra Pradit Pairoh (Mee Duriyangkul) that was inspired by the 
application of the Chinese accent as a secondary melody, which is played by several 
instruments. In the synthesizer and vibraphone parts, I also include musical techniques of Thai 
classical instruments performed in ranad ek (e.g., ti kep) to simulate a Thai musical character.  
 
From a harmonic standpoint, I composed this piece applying chord progressions primarily 
derived from the G♭ major scale, though non-diatonic chord progressions also appear several 
times throughout the piece. (These include non-diatonic chords such as C-7, Fmaj9, D13sus, B6/9.)  
 
“Samniang Jin” has two different rhythmic styles: even eighths, and drum and bass. I use drum 
and bass as a contemporary rhythmic style in popular music, and as a sign of cosmopolitanism, 
as this electronic dance music style, along with its rhythmic elements, has been popular globally 
for more than two decades. Additionally, I use meters such as 7/4 and 5/4 to generate complex 
rhythmic ideas throughout the composition. The total duration of “Samniang Jin” is nine 
minutes and thirty seconds.

COMPOSITIONAL DISCUSSIONS 
 
I composed “Samniang Jin” with the intention to imitate the texture of Thai classical music—
namely polyphonic stratification. As Morton states, the construction of Thai music in this 
",212,1536

CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
182 
texture consists of different “layers” that are not a close approximation of the main melody 
but have different characteristics and a style of their own.307 The musical texture of “Samniang 
Jin” primarily consists of between two and four independent lines. I include this texture in 
multiple instances throughout the composition, which adds a distinct contrast to its other 
textures, which are often homophonic and more typical of jazz orchestra compositions (Figure 
7.13).  
 
Figure 7.13. An example of the musical texture of polyphonic stratification in 
“Samniang Jin” (mm.31-36). 
 
Inspired by the utilization of luk lo, luk kut (i.e., call and response)—the Thai compositional 
technique that I have explicitly drawn from “Choed Jin”—I created a thematic melody that 
consists of short motifs that interact with each other but operate in opposite directions, in a 
similar manner to luk lo, luk kut techniques. This compositional technique contributes to the

development of the thematic melodic lines that mimic one of the main characteristics of Thai 
melodies (Figure 7.14). 
 
Figure 7.14: The utilization of “luk lo, luk kut” in “Samniang Jin” (mm.89-90). 
 
Similar to the compositional techniques utilized in “Buang-Suang,” the imitation of ti kep—the 
idiomatic performance of ranad ek—can be observed in several sections of “Samniang Jin,” 
such as the introduction (Figure 7.15) and the climax (Figure 7.16). To imitate ti kep, I 
constructed eighth-note rhythmic patterns with mostly stepwise melodic contours, in a similar 
manner to the ti kep implemented in ranad ek performances. This melodic pattern is primarily 
played by the vibraphone and synthesizer, which both generate the sound of a percussion-type 
instrument similar to the ranad ek. During the climax section, other instruments such as the 
trumpet and trombone also perform this instrumental imitation to emphasize the character of 
the ranad ek, interacting with the intensive improvisation of the lead alto saxophone.

To significantly integrate the musical elements of the Thai-Chinese accent, I employed the 
melodic patterns of “Choed Jin,” which I obtained from Panya Roongruang’s musical 
manuscript, Collected Works of the Thai Classical Repertoire Vol.4.308 The process of integrating such 
melodic patterns into the composition began when I experimentally played the musical 
transcription of “Choed Jin” on the piano in an attempt to identify the specific melodic lines 
that illustrated the typical sound of Thai-Chinese melodies. I discovered several melodic lines 
from thang ranad ek and thang ranad thum, which I then adjusted to be performed by the

vibraphone, soprano saxophone, synthesizer, and guitar parts in various places. Additionally, 
as demonstrated in Roongruang’s musical manuscript, the musical form of “Choed Jin” 
consists of four distinct sections. I later applied the prominent melodic lines collected from 
these four distinct sections to the important parts of “Samniang Jin” (Figure 7.17). (See 
Roongruang, Collected Works of the Thai Classical Repertoire Vol. 4, pp. 1, 40, 60, and 62 in mm. 1-

“PATCHIM” (“EPILOGUE”) 
 
I composed “Patchim” (“Epilogue”) with the purpose of creating a jazz orchestra piece 
inspired by one specific type of Thai classical music known as phleng la (a farewell song). As 
such, “Patchim” is to be performed as the final composition of this project. The fundamental 
melodic lines of “Patchim” were constructed by using a twelve-tone row intermingled with two 
Thai melodies (thamnong lak) from the phleng la pieces “Pra Artit Ching Duang” and “Tao Kin 
Pak Buk.”309 I include a spoken-word performance of an original poem, which was inspired by 
                                                        
309 Both compositions are in the “farewell” category and are often employed as the final composition to end Thai 
musical performances. “Pra Artit Ching Duang” was originally written for Somdet Chao Phraya Sri Suriwongse 
by Pra Pradit Pairoh (Mee Duriyangkul), while “Tao Kin Pak Buk” is the ancient composition derived from the

CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
186 
the lyrical interpretation of “Pra Artit Ching Duang” by Pra Pradit Pairoh (Mee Duriyangkul), 
in the final section of this piece310, where the poem is read and combined with melodic lines 
performed by the trumpet section. 
 
Because I built the melodic lines primarily utilizing a twelve-tone row, the harmonic rhythm of 
“Patchim” is predominantly based on a vertical approach. To create the harmonies, I first chose 
the pitches that the row generated, then added suitable harmonies to reflect a modern jazz 
sound quality. The harmonic progression of the improvisation sections also follows the chord 
progression of C-minor blues to highlight jazz idioms. Similar to the rhythmic concept of 
“Samniang Jin,” the rhythm of “Patchim” includes a feel with primarily even eighth notes, and 
sounds including electronic drums. The use of hip-hop and rock drumming patterns in the 
final section emphasizes the influence of popular music and invokes a sense of contemporary 
culture.

COMPOSITIONAL DISCUSSIONS 
 
To compose the melodic lines of “Patchim” in the D section, I constructed two main melodic 
patterns, which consist of the original melodic line from the twelve-tone row, and my 
adaptation of a melody from “Pra Artit Ching Duang.” For the first melodic pattern, I created 
a twelve-tone row on my sketch score and then applied it to the guitar and synthesizer parts 
(mm.38 – 41, Figure 7.18). The melodic line of “Pra Artit Ching Duang” (See Tramote, 
Manuscript Vol. 1, p.183), which was originally composed by Pra Pradit Pairoh (Mee 
Duriyangkul).311 To apply this melodic line to my composition, I doubled the note values of 
the original melody, modified their pitch to avoid the collision of minor 2nd intervals that may 
be created by the guitar and synthesizer parts, and then applied them to the trumpet, and

trombone (mm.38-41). This produces the sound of a Thai melodic style in combination with 
the less predictable line generated by the twelve-tone patterns.  
 
 
Figure 7.18: The D section of “Patchim” (mm.37-41). Twelve-tone row melody 
appears in the guitar and piano, melody based on “Pra Artit Ching Duang” in the 
brass. 
 
In the next section, rather than employing two melodic lines as I did in section D, I created 
new thematic melodies through the combination of “Tao Kin Pak Buk,” from the Thai Music 
Book Vol. 3 with my original melody in mm.54-59. To create this new thematic melody, I first 
adjusted the note values of the “Tao Kin Pak Buk” melody using augmentation and diminution 
techniques similar to those used by Thai composers, and then alternated the melody with my 
own original melody. In addition, this particular melodic line was interchangeably performed 
in the soprano saxophone improvisation (Figure 7.19). (See Mahawinitmontri and Issarangkun, 
Thai Music Manuscript Vol. 3, p.130 for the original melody of “Tao Kin Pak Buk.”)

Luk leuam, a Thai instrumental technique, also features in the E section. This technique is widely 
used in ranad thum and plays a crucial role in generating textures of Thai music where a variety 
of melodic lines layer on top of one another. I imitate this technique in the 3rd and bass 
trombones and in the 2nd alto; the melody is played by overlapping the lines of these three 
instruments (Figure 7.20), which brings a characteristically Thai sound to this section.

Another Thai musical element presented in “Patchim” is the interpretation of the lyrics of “Pra 
Artit Ching Duang.” According to Thanatip Paopan, the meaning of the lyrics of “Pra Artit 
Ching Duang” in Pra Pradit Pairoh’s version can be divided into two distinct sections 312. The 
meaning of the first part of the text is ambiguous and can be interpreted in many ways; it may 
refer to the political power of Somdet Chao Phraya Sri Suriwongse, who was a Thai regent 
during the early reign of King Rama V, and was the most powerful authority during the 
transition from the reign of King Rama IV to Rama V. The second part directly expresses the 
                                                        
312 Paopan further explains that the lyrics of “Pra Artit Ching Duang,” in Pra Pradit Pairoh (Mee Duriyangkul)’s 
version, was taken from Khun Chang Khun Phaen, a prominent text in Thai literature. Paopan, “Dynamic of Pra 
Artit Ching Duangin Thai Traditional Music Culture,” 57.

tragic love story derived from Khun Chang Khun Phaen.313 Inspired by the tragic love expressed 
in the lyrics of “Pra Artit Ching Duang,” I composed a short poem that is performed as a 
spoken-word monologue during the melody-out section of “Patchim” (mm.317-345). The 
poem depicts Artit (the sun), Duang (the moon), and cites the names of several flowers—such 
as jasmine and dahlia—referenced in the original lyrics. This poem describes two subjects who 
are unable to be together no matter how hard they try:

“MEKONG” (“RIVER OF SOULS”) 
 
“Mekong” (“River of Souls”) is a jazz orchestra composition that artistically expresses the 
sound of northeast Thailand (isan nuea) by using—among other elements—characteristics of 
traditional Thai melodies of the region. This composition intermingles multiple elements from 
                                                        
313 Khun Chang Khun Phaen is a Thai epic poem based on a Thai folklore legend and considered one of the most 
influential works of Thai literature. For English translation, see The Tale of Khun Chang Khun Phaen translated and 
edited by Chris Baker and Pasuk Phongpaichi, Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai, Thailand, 2010.

the traditional music of northeast Thailand, such as the performance practices of khaen and 
phin music, with contemporary jazz compositional techniques. In addition, inspired by the 
compositional form of Thai classical music form called phleng ruang, (a suite of ancient tunes 
with a common theme) the thematic melodies of “River of Souls” reference the Thai classical 
music repertoire that has a “Lao accent” (samniang lao), as well as prominent northeast 
traditional compositions (dontri isan nuea).  
 
The melodic lines in this composition were inspired by two compositions from northeastern 
traditional repertoires, “Lai Lom Phat Phrao” and “Lai Teay Khong.” They were also inspired 
by four musical interpretations of the Lao accent category performed in Thai classical music 
repertoires: “Lao Somdej,” “Lao Pan,” “Lao Dum Noen Sai,” and “Lao Duang Duen.”314 
These concepts appear in various sections of the composition and performed by the soprano 
saxophone, alto saxophone, trumpets, vocalist, bass, and bass trombone. 
 
From a harmonic standpoint, I have applied techniques of contemporary jazz orchestra 
composition—such as quartal and spread voicings, extended harmonies, modal interchanges, 
and pedal points—to imitate the sound of the drone characteristically produced in isan nuea 
performances. Three rhythmic styles that often exist in jazz orchestra arrangements—even 
eighth-notes, swing, and Afro-Cuban rhythms—occur in the rhythm section parts. I also 
composed using polyrhythms, asymmetrical phrases, and rhythmic displacement in numerous 
places. 
 
The total duration of “Mekong” is twelve minutes and seventeen seconds, and it is the longest 
composition of this study.

314 Even some Thai classical music with a Lao accent, such as “Lao Duang Duen,” was geographically derived in 
present-day northern Thailand. This composition was well recognized by Thai classical musicians as phleng seminang 
lao (song in a Lao accent). Furthermore, it is notable that throughout the Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin periods, 
Siamese living in the central area referred to some of the Northern tribes who share cultures with the people of 
modern-day Laos as “Lao.”

COMPOSITIONAL DISCUSSIONS  
 
In the introduction of the work, a solo in the lead alto saxophone, I imitate the performance 
techniques of khaen, including the construction of intervallic patterns, and standard rhythmic 
",98,733

CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
199 
patterns, which are, in most cases, perpetual rhythms executed in eighth-note and sixteenth-
note contexts. To reference the intervallic patterns of khaen performance, I constructed 
particular patterns that gradually build off the target notes, including the expansion from the 
pitch A, and the development of intervallic patterns from the pitch G—similar to the 
performance in the Sombat Simlah’s khaen performance from Chapter 4. In addition, I 
employed eighth-note and sixteenth-note patterns in a similar manner to Sombat’s 
performance (the C section of the transcription of the performance in Chapter 4), to construct 
standard rhythmic patterns for this section. Other contemporary performance techniques such 
as slap tongue, fluttertongue, and multiphonics are also used to reference the sounds of khaen  
performance in this section (Figure 7.22).   
 
 
Figure 7.22:  The imitation of khaen performance in the alto saxophone part of 
“Mekong” (concert key). 
 
Later on in the introduction, I adapt the melody from northeastern traditional composition 
“Lai Teay Khong” for the lower-pitched instruments and guitar (mm.23-.26). This melody is 
played together with a drone on the pitch A (mm.22–26), later restated at the defining moments 
of this composition, including after the solo section and in the ending section. For the

adaptation of “Lai Teay Khong” used during the introductory sections, the sound of the drone 
is reproduced by the electric piano (Figure 7.23). 
 
 
Figure 7.23:  The adaptation of “Lai Teay Khong,” with drone on A in the electric 
piano, from “Mekong” (mm.22-26). 
 
For the B section, I composed melodic lines that were inspired by mm. 9-13 of the melody 
“Lao Pan” (Figure 7.24)315, which I recently transcribed for this composition. The melodic 
adaptation of “Lao Pan” is performed by the first and second trumpets in mm.31-36 (Figure 
7.25), and later transposed down a perfect fourth in a sequence performed by the guitar and 
electric piano for the second theme. In addition, modal interchange between A Aeolian and A 
Phrygian modes occurs at the entrance of the B♭maj7 chord in m. 36.

Similar to my interpretation of khaen performances, I have also referenced the performance 
practice of phin, which featured extensively in my transcription process (in particular, 
performances by Boomma Kaowong and Thongsai Thabthanon.) To do so, I composed 
eighth-note melodic lines which utilize the pitches of F as drones, gradually ascending to the 
note of B♭—the highest pitch—before switching to neighbor pitches without taking extensive 
leaps (e.g., mm.74 -86). This phin performance method is widely to incorporated into the guitar 
part (Figure 7.26).

In the melody section (section C) of “Mekong”, I composed the melodic lines by interpreting 
the traditional melody of “Lao Somdej” (transcribed in Chapter 3). Melodic expansion, 
diminution, anticipation, and delayed attacks, as well as rhythmic displacements, play crucial 
roles in facilitating the extensive development of this melody. After I had adapted this melody, 
I applied modal interchanges and modern non-functional harmonies to enrich the tone colors 
of this melodic line and to emphasize the character of a modern jazz orchestra. The comparison 
between the original melody of “Lao Somdej” and my melodic arrangement implemented in  
the C section is illustrated in Figures 7.27 and 7.28.

Figure 7.28: The thematic melody of “Mekong” (mm.93-135) in the C section.  
 
I also applied an ostinato to generate intricate ideas by and provide contrast to the melodic 
lines of “Mekong,” aiming to produce an intense response in the audiences from the first 
climax section to the improvisational segment (Figure 7.29).

Figure 7.29:  An example of an ostinato from “Mekong” (mm.118-121). 
 
“Mekong” features solos at E and at F, over functional harmony in the keys of C natural minor 
and F major. The trumpet solo begins at E and continues into F, where it is accompanied by 
contrapuntal lines in the bass. This is followed by a solo in the lead alto, while “Lom Phat 
Phrao” melody is played by the lead and third trumpets, second alto, and tenor. 
 
The first solo section featuring the lead trumpet has a 32-bar form, and is in the key of C natural 
minor. The harmony includes i7 (m.163), v7 (m.167), and ♭VII7(m.171), and also borrows 
chords from other modes to produce interesting and exciting harmonies such as vi-7 (m.183, 
Ionian) II7 (m.191, Lydian), and bVmaj7 (m.187, Locrian), as well as the ii-V-I progression to 
emphasize typical jazz harmonic constructions. In addition, I also include irregular meters such 
as 3/4 and 5/4 to provide measures of varying duration, and to contribute a sense that the 
rhythm of this section is unpredictable (Figure 7.30).

The thematic material from “Lai Lom Phat Phrao,” which was obtained from my 
transcription (see Chapter 4), was also applied to the final solo section in the key of F major 
to generate the characteristic melodic sound of isan nuea music, intermingled with the 
improvisation of the lead alto saxophone and electric piano. This melody is played by the 
soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, the lead and third trumpet, and guitar (mm. 225-229, 
as illustrated in Figure 7.31).

Similar to the musical adaption of “Lao Somdej,” I adjusted the melodic lines of the prominent 
Thai classical music composition featuring the musical accent of Laos called “Lao Dum Noen 
Sai.”316 These lines appear in the fundamental melodies in the first head-out section, and 
provide the characteristic sound of Thai classical music. The compositional techniques I used 
to create new melodic lines in this case include melodic expansion, contrapuntal motion, 
delayed attacks, and changing meters (4/4 to 3/4). In addition, to make the rhythmic patterns 
more attractive and interesting, I used syncopated patterns in accompanying instruments and 
low-voice instruments including electric piano, bass, baritone saxophone, and bass trombone.

The key center of “Mekong” also modulates from A natural minor to F major, and I also use 
modal interchange in several instances, such as II7 (Lydian) and I-7 (Aeolian). I also construct 
modern harmonies and strengthen the characteristic sound of pentatonic scales through 
including two parts written primarily in perfect fifths and quartal voicings (Figure 7.33).  
 
Figure 7.33: Compositional techniques employed in mm. 269-274 of “Mekong.” 
 
Rather than repeating the melodic lines of “Lao Dum Noen Sai,” I decided to select another 
piece from the traditional Thai musical repertoire that features the Lao musical accents called 
",105,699
225," 
CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
209 
“Lao Duang Duen.”317 This piece, containing one of the most memorable melodic lines in Thai 
music, intermingles with the sound of the jazz orchestra in the final head-out section of 
“Mekong.” Similar to other traditional Thai melodies applied and integrated into this 
composition, the thematic melody of “Lao Duang Duen” was also extended, adjusted, and 
blended to the harmonic structures and rhythms of jazz. Afro-Cuban rhythms were further 
applied to create the energetic movement that generates rhythmic diversity, in addition to 
employing even eighth notes and swing rhythms. Furthermore, this rhythmic pattern provides 
the syncopated patterns which form a distinct opposition to the character of Thai melodic 
rhythms. 
 
For the voicing techniques to harmonize the Thai melody, I use conventional techniques such 
as four-way close voicings, non-dissonant clusters, two-part writing with smooth intervals (for 
example, major 3rd or major 6th), and then subsequently adjust these to contemporary 
techniques such as quartal and quintal voicings or extended chords. Contrapuntal lines provide 
complexity for the melodic lines in the baritone saxophone and bass trombone parts, as in the 
final head-out section. To construct syncopated rhythms against the main melodic lines, I used 
triplets to produce a rhythmic feel in the Afro-Cuban drum patterns as rhythmic 
accompaniments for the brass sections, bass, and baritone saxophone. These accompanying 
patterns also contribute to the rhythmic intensity which can provide a more exciting groove 
for the audience (Figures 7.34).

To express more of the aesthetics of Thai musical culture, I also translated the lyrics of “Lao 
Duang Duen”318 into English and made my own adaptation, which can be sung in combination 
with wordless vocals (scat singing) by a female vocalist in the H section of “Mekong.” The 
English translation of “Lao Duang Duen” is as follows: 
 
Oh my love, my precious moon  
I just come to say that I love you for one last time  
                                                        
318 “Lao Duang Duen” was originally composed by Prince Benbadhanabongse, who was the third-eighth King 
Chulalongkorn’s son. The story behind this composition’s lyric expresses his regret for Princess Chomchuen, 
whom he was unable to marry. Benjamin Pongtep Cefkin, “Lao Duang Duen” “Lost in Translation: A New 
Perspective on the Southeast Asian Classical Arts,” American Music Research Journal, Vol. 27 2018, 30-31.

For the final section “Mekong,” I employed the rhythmic intensity of triplet rhythms related 
to Afro-Cuban rhythmic patterns to create rhythmic unification for the ensemble. I later 
approach the climax segment with a rapid passage of the set of sixteen notes in the lead and 
second trumpets (m.334). The prominent theme of “Lai Teay Khong” also appears and is 
restated again in the bass, vocal, bass trombone parts (mm.329 - 334) to connect and conclude 
the entire story of this composition. Such compositional techniques also operated in 
conjunction with the intensive improvisation of the soprano saxophone, and the second alto 
(Figure 7.36).

The outro of “Mekong” in the I section begins with a ritardando. The final melodic line of this 
section is played by the two trumpets and the second alto, and then later supported by two 
trombones and the tenor saxophone. My intention in composing this part was to allow the 
audience unwind after listening to this extended composition. In addition, the final melodic 
lines of “Mekong” (min. 349-351) were composed by replicating the sound of a penta-centric

concept that is significantly influenced by isan nuea melodies. The final chord of “Mekong” is 
also generated by the combination of quartal and quintal voicings (C♯9sus), which can create a 
bright tone and a sense of freshness (Figure 7.37).

7.4 COMPOSITIONS INSPIRED BY DONTRI PAKTAI  
“SINGORA” (“DANCE OF KINNARI”) 
 
“Singora” was the name of a cosmopolitan city in southern Thailand located in the present-
day province of Songkhla, where performances of nora and rong ngeng are still widespread. The 
musical elements of nora and rong ngeng serve as the principal ingredients of this composition. 
Strategies for adapting these musical elements include: the use of the “Sot Soi” melodic pattern, 
the application of the kheun hua pi technique of pi nora, the rhythmic adaption of rong ngeng 
tanyong performances, and the thematic melody of “Tari Kipas” as performed by Khadae 
Waedeng, which I also transcribed from the southeastern rong ngeng repertoire for this 
composition. Furthermore, I have included two monologues that narrate the romantic story of 
Pra Suthon and Manora—which is one of the famous Thai works of literature used in nora 
performances.  
 
The thematic melody of the composition is divided into two sections, namely a musical 
adaptation of two melodies from the “Sot Sot” (nora) and “Tari Kipas” (Southeastern rong 
ngeng), and the original melodies I composed to respond to them. “Singora” is based on E♭ 
Mixolydian, F Lydian dominant, and G Ionian modes. The modulation techniques without 
pivot chords in various sections of the composition create a feeling of surprise and 
unpredictability.  
 
To express the rhythmic ideas of southern Thai music, I adapted traditional Afro-Cuban 
rhythmic patterns, which, in my view, function effectively alongside southern Thai melodic 
rhythms. I use swing, hip-hop drum beats, and patterns of contemporary jazz fusion to create 
fundamental rhythmic patterns in the rhythm section. In addition, intricate polyrhythmic ideas 
appear in the brass and the rhythm sections in multiple places. I have also applied the rhythmic 
patterns of rong ngeng tanyoung (southwest)—the sinadong patterns and the rebana patterns of the 
Lagu dua composition—in several places in the bass and percussion parts.  
 
The primary improvisation sections of “Singora” are the short ad-lib solo and the main solo 
section. The soloists in the first “monologue” of this composition include the guitar and second 
tenor saxophone, while the primary improvisation section features soprano saxophone and 
trumpet. The second “monologue” also features a combined duo improvisation of soprano

216 
saxophone and guitar, providing a musical interaction with the spoken word performed by the 
singer. 
 
Rather than using the standard form of jazz orchestras, the musical form of “Singora” is a 
narrative story whose melody parts are not repeated, with each part blending into the 
monologue and improvisation sections. The musical form of this composition consists of eight 
sections (from A to H) totaling nine minutes and seven seconds, which are illustrated in the

COMPOSITIONAL DISCUSSIONS  
 
The initial idea behind composing “Singora” was to apply the rhythmic ideas of rong ngeng 
performances. To do so, I selected the rhythmic patterns of sinadong played by the rebana in rong 
ngeng tanyong performances, then reducing the tempo to half-time and applying them to the 
principal bass line in the A section. The comparison between the sinadong and the bass patterns 
is demonstrated in Figure 7.38.   
 
 
 
Figure 7.38: A comparison between the sinadong pattern and the bass part of 
“Singora” in mm.5-8. 
 
The chord progressions accompanying the first monologue in the B section can be separated 
in two: in the first section, which consists of sixteen measures, I applied a chord progression 
based on E♭ Mixolydian and consisting of 1) Fsus4 (II7) borrowed from the parallel key of E♭ 
Lydian, 2) D♭add9 (♭VII7), and 3) C-11/E♭ (VI-7). The voicing techniques applied in this section 
also include the use of fourth voicings for Fsus4, E♭sus4, and D♭add9, as well as four-way closed 
voicings in C-11/E♭. The application of 3 over 6 and 4 over 6 polyrhythms have been included 
to contribute interesting rhythmic ideas, which appear in the woodwind and brass sections in 
the chords E♭sus4 and C-11/E♭ (Figure 7.39).

Figure 7.39: The chord progressions and polyrhythms accompanying the first 
monologue in “Singora” (mm.25-40). 
      
I also applied the rhythm of the rebana from the lagu dua composition from rong ngeng tanyong 
performances. Thai rhythmic ideas in this pattern are constructed by groups of four notes and 
then groups of five notes; I included this pattern in the conga part in mm.36–40 and mm.54–
55 (Figure 7.40). 
 
",74,492
239," 
CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
223 
I also included the lagu dua rhythmic pattern in the baritone saxophone part (mm.39-.40), which 
contributes additional contrasting rhythmic ideas to the polyrhythms of the soprano saxophone 
and the brass section (also in Figure 7.40).  
 
 
 
 
Figure 7.40: The application of the lagu dua rhythmic pattern in the conga part, and 
in the baritone saxophone part, of “Singora.” 
 
The harmonic progressions applied in the second part of the B section are based on the key of 
F Lydian, which consists of G7sus4 (II7), and E♭-11(bvii-7) borrowed from F Phrygian. The 
voicing in the fourth and closed positions (four-way close voicing) can also be identified in the 
woodwinds and brass sections. To integrate the musical elements of southern Thailand, I 
applied the kheun hua pi technique—one of the prominent characteristics of the pi nora 
performance—to the soprano saxophone part, which yielded an effective result when used in 
the prototype composition in Chapter 5. In this technique, the soprano saxophone player 
gradually performs the target notes—moving from quarter notes to eighth notes—and applies 
a tremolo technique, as illustrated in the chords of G7sus4, F6, and E♭-11 in the woodwind section. 
 
Another compositional technique that I employed to express the sound of traditional southern 
Thai music was the adaptation of a performance practice by a set of two gongs (mong) that is 
frequently heard in nora performances and provided the distinctive sound characteristic to this 
music. To apply this musical technique, I constructed two sets of sounds—containing the 
",252,1652

CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
224 
pitches of D and A, and E♭ and A♭ respectively—to be continually performed by the bass 
trombone parts in a similar manner to a mong performance (Figure 7.41) 
 
Figure 7.41: Compositional techniques employed in the B section of “Singora” 
(mm.43-54). 
 
For this piece I also translated the story of Pra Suthon and Manora, which is one of the most 
prominent pieces of Thai literature performed in nora performances in southern Thailand. This 
story portrays the romantic relationship between a mythical female half-human bird and a male 
prince. The spoken text of this section is narrated by the female vocalist in mm.25-59 by using 
distortion effects to produce a more modern sound suited to the composition. My English 
translation of the story is quoted below: 
 
",132,831
241," 
CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
225 
Pra Suthon and Manora is a story of forbidden love between a human and a female mythical figure, who is half-
bird and half-human and lives beyond the Himavanta forest. One day, while taking a bath in an ancient lake in 
the mysterious forest of the human realm, Manora is captured by Phran Boon, a ferocious hunter, who later 
hands her over to Pra Suthon, the heir to the Kingdom of Uttarapancala. As soon as they see each other, they 
fall in love because of the loving spirit that they had in their past lives. However, a jealous brahmin falsely tells 
the king, Artit Wong, Pra Suthon’s father, that Manora would bring about a deterioration of his reign and 
requests the sacrifice of Manora. So reluctantly, Manora leaves Pra Suthon behind without saying goodbye and 
secretly flees to Mouth Kailash, where humans are unable to go.319 
 
For the first thematic melody of “Singora,” I transcribed the prominent melodic pattern of the 
composition “Tari Kipas”320 performed by Khadae Waedeng (Figure 7.42). Then, I retained 
the target notes of B♭ and of the group of descending notes to the pitch C (in the red circles), 
which I later include in the melody I composed for the soprano saxophone (Figure 7.43).

319 The story of Pra Suthon and Manora is a popular Thai performance that can be seen throughout Thailand, in 
particular the center. The plot of this literature has been also reproduced and appears in Thai TV programs 
several times. For the introduction of the story of Pra Suthon and Manora, see Henry D. Ginsburg, “The 
Manora Dance-Drama: An introduction< https://thesiamsociety.org/wp-

uploaded by The Siam Society (n.d.). 
320 The original melody of “Tari Kipas” was transcribed from Khadae Waedeng’s performance, which was 
released by theOngkhaphayop at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ88gk-GNKY> (January 23, 2011).

CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
226 
Besides adapting the remaining “Tari Kipas” melody to construct the melodic lines of 
“Singora,” I composed an original melody that functions as an answer passage to the “Tari 
Kipas” melody. These melodic lines consist of the combination of an E♭ minor pentatonic 
scale—based on the character of the Thai melody—and a C Phrygian dominant scale (m.74). 
This produces a sound akin to another significant influence of rong ngeng music––Arabic 
music—and appears in the third trumpet part (Figure 7.44). 
 
 
Figure 7.44:  The melody from “Singora” in the third trumpet part (mm.69-76). 
 
To combine the sound of nora music with rong ngeng performances, I applied the short melodic 
line of the “Sot Soi” pattern (transcribed in Chapter 5), and then made adaptions to the vocal, 
lead alto (soprano saxophone) and trumpet parts, allowing this melody to function as the 
thematic melody of the D section (Figure 7.45). I also avoided an overly repetitive sound of 
this memorable pattern through key changes and rhythmic adjustments. For example, I shifted 
the melody from the E♭ major scale to the C Locrian by adding the pitch D♭ (m.118), which 
is performed by the vocalist. This technique also provides the sound of the flat 2, which is 
another integration of the characteristic sound rong ngeng music to nora performance (Figure 
7.46).

The first climax of the piece, in the E section, also utilizes extended harmonies to produce a 
contemporary jazz sound. These harmonies include the use of upper structure triad—
principally, the B/A chords (m.118), from which I omit the note of E in the bottom chord to 
highlight the sound of ♯11 (in the key of A) produced by third of the B major triad (D♯). The 
progressions of B/A, E♭6/9, and C6/9 also provide unconventional chord movements which can 
decrease the sense of predictability that is often present in other transitional sections in jazz 
orchestra writings. Eventually, I also include the short thematic melody of “Sot Soi” in 
mm.119- 120 to conclude the story of this part of the composition before entering the first 
",158,961
244," 
CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
228 
climax section. This occurs with a C6/9 chord, to which I applied quintal voicings in the 
trombone section (m.121) in order to produce a brighter sound and project a modern voicing. 
 
 
Figure 7.47: The first climax of “Singora” (mm.118-123). 
 
Rather than moving to the solo section after the first climax section, I constructed a short 
thematic melody part to avoid the sense of predictability of conventional jazz orchestra 
compositions, where a solo typically follows an initial climax. I composed the first melody (17 
measures) in the guitar and soprano saxophone based on the B♭ major pentatonic scale, 
another reference to the penta-centric elements of Thai music (Figure 7.48).

Figure 7.48: The melody in the E section of “Singora.” Excerpt from the guitar part in 
mm.130-147. 
 
To further express the distinct sound of southern Thai music as integrated with my original 
melody, I composed the vibraphone part, which references the sound of the mong and consists 
of two sets of continually alternating pitches similar to the previous compositional techniques 
discussed earlier. The first pattern of pitches consists of the sounds of C and G which 
emphasize the tension of the 9th and 13th (harmonically speaking) over the B♭ major pentatonic 
scale used in the main melodic line. The second pattern includes the pitches of C and F, which 
produce tension as the 9th and 5th of B♭ major (again, harmonically speaking). Because of the 
similarity between the vibraphone and mong as idiophones (and metallophones), the 
construction of these patterns also reproduces strong elements of nora performances (Figure 
7.49).

For the second melody of the E section, I recapitulate the “Tari Kipas” melody in the vocal 
and soprano parts whose rhythmic structures contrast those that appear earlier (in the C 
section). I also modulate the key for the second repetition, with this melody moving to G major 
(m.161). In addition, the second tenor (soprano saxophone) plays an ad-lib improvisation to 
produce contrapuntal lines over the melody part and provide a structural transformation before 
entering the improvisational section (Figure 7.50).

CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
231 
Similar to the compositional process of the introduction section of “Mekong” which was 
inspired by Sombat Simlah’s performance, I also employ the melodic lines of “Patcha,” which 
were transcribed from Umnad Nuniad’s performance in Chapter 5 (mm.79-88), to serve as the 
thematic melody at the beginning of the second climax. These melodic lines were transposed 
down a major sixth from the original key before being applied to the lead trumpet in mm.185-
188 (Figure 7.51). 
 
 
Figure 7.51: The adaption of the melodic lines of “Patcha” (mm. 185-187) obtained 
from Umnad Nuniad’s performance. 
 
For the second climax of the piece in mm.189-198, I use various compositional techniques to 
create harmonic and rhythmic density and encourage the musical expression of the two soloists 
(the soprano saxophone and the trumpet players). These compositional techniques include 
semi-tutti passages performed by the brass section to produce percussive attacks, and a 
rhythmic ostinato produced by the guitar, second alto, and to some extent bass parts to echo 
the rhythmic complexity that has been integrated into the improvisation. Additionally, the 
polyrhythm created by the lead trumpet part creates a contradiction to the semi-tutti passages 
and rhythmic patterns of the soloists.  
 
The harmonic progressions in the climax sections are characterized by the non-harmonic 
functions of the extended chords G7sus4, A-11, B♭-11and D♭9sus, and in particular, the harmonic 
motion from B♭-11 to D♭9sus. These progressions generate unexpected chord movements to 
supply excitement to the listeners. Doubled bass lines are also evident in the baritone 
saxophone, bass trombone, and bass parts until the end of the solo section (m.200), creating 
",268,1807
248," 
CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
232 
contrapuntal motions toward the improvisation and providing a resolution to the climax 
section before moving to the next section (Figure 7.52).

Figure 7.52b: The second climax section of “Singora,” continued. 
 
The rhythmic patterns and harmonic progressions used in the G section (the second 
monologue) draw on the practice of contemporary jazz fusion that integrates musical elements 
from neo-soul, R&B, and gospel music. For example, I based the drum patterns in the piece 
on those frequently employed in contemporary R&B, adapting them to this composition 
(Figure 7.53).

In this section, the second monologue (mm.215 – 244) concludes of the story of Pra Suthon 
and Manora. This monologue is also narrated by the female vocalist and is supported by the 
rhythm and harmony of contemporary jazz fusion. An English translation of the second  
monologue is provided below:   
 
“I insistently forbid him to follow me because the journey to the realm of Kinnari, a world of half-bird and half-
human, is extremely perilous. The route to my world is certainly not for humans, but for non-humans only,” 
says Manora. However, despite the warning, Pra Suthon still relentlessly chases her and wishes to bring his lover 
back. Along the way, Pra Suthon encounters several poisonous forests and a flooded river where a colossal 
python lies as an obstacle. Then he must sneak into the nest of the gigantic birds in the mythical world, where 
he must be patient and wait until all ferocious creatures fly away so that he can slowly climb up to the top of 
Mouth Kailash where he will eventually be reunited with his love. The journey of Pra Suthon and Manora took 
seven years, seven months, and seven days, providing us with a great story of persistence and showing us the 
power of love to overcome difference—in this case, between human and non-human. 
 
In terms of the harmonic design of this section, I made significant use of extended harmonies 
containing ma9 and m9 chords, which can be frequently heard in neo-soul and contemporary 
gospel music. In addition, the chord progressions used to accompany this second monologue 
were influenced by the chord progressions of contemporary jazz fusion. These chords—
namely A♭ma9 (♭IIIma7), G♭6/9 (♭IIma7), F-9 (i-7), E♭ma9 (♭VIIma9), and C-9 (v9), all of which relate to 
the key of F major—can be frequently observed in the chord progressions of contemporary 
jazz music. The entire chord progressions constructed to accompany the second monologue 
(34 measures) are demonstrated in the guitar parts (Figure 7.54).

Figure 7.54: The harmonic design of the second monologue of “Singora” (mm.215-

Other compositional techniques applied in the G section also include the construction of a 
thematic melody and the deployment of an ad-lib solo, which both interact and communicate 
with the monologue. For the thematic melody used in this section, I sought to compose 
melodic lines containing a memorable melody in the lead trumpet. The intensity of this 
thematic melody increases in the second trumpet, soprano saxophone, baritone saxophone, 
and bass parts in order to stimulate the audience’s emotional response. Before reaching the 
conclusion of the second monologue, the guitar player and the first alto (on soprano 
saxophone) perform an ad-lib improvisation, integrate their musical expression with the story  
from ancient Thai literature (Figure 7.55).

Figure 7.55: Compositional techniques applied in the G section of “Singora” 
(mm.241-246). 
 
Inspired by polyrhythmic practices, the structure of the final part of “Singora” is based on four 
separate rhythmic patterns. These four distinct rhythms occur in different sections of the 
ensemble. The first occurs in the woodwind section, which performs a fast-moving passage 
",62,437
253," 
CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
237 
and provides rapid melodic movements to gain the attention of the audience. The second is in 
the trumpets, which deliver a syncopated percussive accompaniment and create a rhythmic 
intensity in the section. The third occurs in the rhythm section, which performs in eighth-note 
patterns to produce contrapuntal motion against the woodwind section. Last, the trombone 
section introduces a pattern of four pulses of equal duration within each six-beat measure to 
contribute a sophisticated polyrhythm when performing together with the other sections 
(Figure 7.56).

composition. Another musical element acquired from nora music concerns the imitation of the

7.5 COMPOSITIONS INSPIRED BY DONTRI PAKNUEA  
 “WIANG HAENG” (“THE NORTHERN RHAPSODY”) 
 
My intention in composing “Wiang Haeng” (“The Northern Rhapsody”), a work in the style 
of a jazz ballad, is to create a contemporary composition for a jazz orchestra that musically 
expresses the sound of northern traditional music of Thailand. This composition also attempts 
to aesthetically depict the mountain ranges and valleys of the northern parts of Thailand. To 
create such sounds and provide such depictions, I adapt northern Thai khap saw and sueng 
performance techniques for instruments of the jazz orchestra such as those of the woodwind 
section and the guitar. In addition, I reharmonized two prominent northern traditional 
compositions called “Long Mae Ping,” “Selemao,” and “Fon Ngiew (ฟ้อนเงี%ยว),”321 all of which 
were transcribed specifically for this composition and can be heard in multiple sections. 
 
The fundamental melodies of this composition include an original thematic melody I 
composed, and musical adaptions of two northern traditional melodies, “Selemao” and “Long 
Mae Ping.” The original melody first appears in the flute parts, and constitutes six measures of 
melodic patterns based on the F major pentatonic scale. This melody depicts the sound of calm 
and gentleness of northern Thai music. It is later developed and expanded to four different 
variations.  
 
The harmonic design of “The Northern Rhapsody” is based primarily on non-functional 
chord-to-chord successions. My intention with this compositional approach was to reflect the 
sound of northern traditional melodies through complicated jazz harmonies as much as 
possible. In addition, the use of extended chords such as maj13, sus13, and mi11, as well as 
polychords, are meant to emphasize sounds of tension while creating harmonies for the 
prominent Thai melodies throughout the composition. 
 
The rhythmic style of the composition mimics the performance of jazz ballads and slow 
backbeat drum patterns, where time signatures such as 5/4, 7/4, and 11/8 are employed to 
                                                        
321 “Fon Ngiew” is a Thai classical composition that is performed in the center of Thailand to accompany 
traditional Thai northern dance. The original melody for this song was derived from “Selemao,” a traditional 
northern Thai composition composed by Lamul Yamagupt, a Thai choreographer who had the opportunity to 
teach Siamese Court dance to Princess consort Dara Rasami's troupes in Chiang Mai during King Rama V’s reign 
(Chulalongkorn). Jarun Kanchanapradit, “Tracking Fon-Ngeue Songs: Musical Relationships among Ethnic 
Groups in the Mekong River Basin,” Journal of Mekong Societies 9 Vol. 2 (2013), 82-83.

contribute sophisticated rhythmic concepts to northern Thai melodies and in contrast to the 
3/4 or 4/4 time signatures typical in ballads. Odd-numbered note groupings and rhythmic 
displacements generate contrasting ideas to the rhythmic patterns of slow swing ride-cymbal 
patterns, and appear in the various places of the guitar, organ, bass clarinet, and bass parts.   
 
Unlike in the other compositions, the improvisation of “The Northern Rhapsody” is primarily 
performed by the drummer, which is rare in jazz ballad compositions. The flugelhorn and 
soprano saxophone also improvise in multiple parts of this composition. The total duration of 
this composition is six minutes and fifty-two seconds.

COMPOSITIONAL DISCUSSIONS  
 
The first melody section of “Northern Rhapsody” was constructed by using a retrograde 
technique to the original melody of “Long Mae Ping,”322 which is one of the prominent 
compositions of the northern Thai repertoire that I heard frequently as a child (mm.1-3, as 
shown in Figures 7.58 and 7.59). To compose the melodic lines for this section, the pitch C♯ 
at the beginning and pitch E at the end in rectangle no. 2 were retrograded to the melodic 
pattern in m.2 of the introductory section as shown in Figure 7.59. The order of the pitch set 
from A at the beginning and the pitch of E at the end (of mm. 1-3, Figure 7.58) were also put 
in a backward position to m.3 in the introductory section (Figure 7.59). Moreover, I 
harmonized the remaining melody of “Long Mae Ping” in order to create higher extensions, 
such as an ♯11th in m.5 and a 13th in m.6 performed by the guitar player.

guitar part in mm.1-8. 
 
For the B section, I imitated the khap saw style as it is played by pi jum ensembles described in 
Chapter 6. To imitate this sound, I employed two flutes and two clarinets which similarly 
functioned as wong pi jum si (four instruments). The construction of pi jum melodic lines is also 
based on intervallic features in disjunct motion which typically extend over ascending and 
descending second intervals as also revealed in the transcription in Chapter 6. By adopting such 
characteristics, I constructed several motives from several intervals stretched beyond the 
second interval as played by the two flutes and two clarinets in skip-wise motion.  
 
Another technique I applied in the section is use of perpetual rhythms to imitate the rhythmic 
characteristics of khap saw performances. As explained in Chapter 6, the rhythmic movements 
of khap saw performances are performed as perpetual rhythms without stopping, a pi jum 
performance method called hom lom (involving circular breathing). To imitate this technique, I 
constructed the multiple motive lines which are intertwined with each other and performed in 
the woodwind sections (mm.11 – mm.16) by using the eighth sixteenth, and eighth note triplet 
without any interruptions of the continuous sound of the section (Figure 7.60).

Northern Rhapsody” (mm.11-16). 
 
In another adaptation of the idiomatic sounds of instruments of the northern Thai music 
ensemble, I composed a guitar part that imitated the performance of the sueng (a plucked lute 
instrument) another typical sound of northern Thai music. I applied typical sueng eighth-note 
patterns and its tremolo technique to the guitar parts from mm.10-14 in the B section (Figure 
7.61). 
 
Figure 7.61: The imitation of sueng performance in the guitar part of “The Northern 
Rhapsody” (mm.10-14). 
 
I later composed the thematic melody for the vocal part of “The Northern Rhapsody,” which 
is based on the F major pentatonic scale. My intent was to capture the sound of northern Thai 
music, which tends to be more calm and gentle when compared with the music of other regions 
of Thailand. To express such musical emotion, I attempted to avoid the extended leaps in the 
melody and instead used stepwise movements, as opposed to the previous section to produce 
a fluid melodic line (Figure 7.62).

CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
248 
 
Figure 7.62: The first melody in “The Northern Rhapsody” (mm.22-28). 
 
I develop this thematic melody to generate three distinct melodic variations. In the second 
melodic variation, I partly transposed the fundamental melodic line up a perfect 5th and 
replaced both E♭ and A♭ to avoid the repetition of pentatonic sounds. In addition, I slightly 
adjusted the rhythm of the main melody by using rhythmic anticipations (Figure 7.63). 
 
 
Figure 7.63: The second variation of the melody in “The Northern Rhapsody” 
(mm.29-34).  
 
The construction of melodic lines in the third variation is a combination of the previous 
thematic melody with the new melodies (in the red rectangles in Figure 7.64) that I specifically 
composed for this section. The use of modulations up a minor 2nd from C to D♭ and up a 
major 2nd from D♭ to E♭ in the lead alto in m.37 also provided the harmonic movements before 
entering the fourth thematic variation. Additionally, I added contrapuntal lines in the bass 
clarinet in measures 34-36 (Figure 7.64).

For the fourth thematic variation (the recapitulation section), the original melody modulates 
from F major pentatonic to D♭ major. This melodic pattern is performed by various 
instruments: lead trumpet, lead trombone, and first tenor (soprano saxophone). This provides 
a strong conclusion to all the melody parts of the C section. Furthermore, I composed 
background parts in the brass section by using close voicings, as well as musical ornamentation 
such as trills in the woodwind section to mimic the idiomatic performances of pi jum 
instruments and contribute more dynamic and musical intensity to this recapitulation section 
(Figure 7.65).

The harmonic progressions in the C section are non-functional (Figure 7.66). My intention 
here is to produce intriguing harmonies and an emotional atmosphere for audiences as can be 
experienced, in particular, in listening to jazz ballads. To generate these musical effects, I 
constructed harmonies based on the accented notes of the melodic lines of C section to 
produce the sound of tensions produced by the 9th, 11th, and 13th of particular chords. For 
example, the accented notes of measure 23 are on the pitch G, the ♯11 of D♭ma13, and the 
accented notes of measure 24 are on the pitch D which is the 9 of the C6/9 chord. By 
implementing this compositional technique, I highlight the harmonic tensions of each chord 
and evoke the sound of contemporary jazz voicings.

Figure 7.66: The harmony of the C section of “The Northern Rhapsody” (mm.23-38). 
 
The melodic lines of the D section were generated by two approaches. The first is the melodic 
adaption of the chorus section of “Fon Ngiew,”323 a Thai classical music composition that 
adapted one of Northern Thai music’s most well-known pieces, “Selemao” (Figure 7.67). The 
melodic lines are played by two altos in m.48 and m.49, where I intend to conceal the melody 
of “Fon Ngiew” under other musical components. I also composed an original melody to 
interact with the adaptation of Fon Ngiew, performed by soprano saxophone and trumpet with 
harmon mute (mm.45- 50). I then employed changing meters from 3/4 to 5/4, to 4/4, and 
back to 3/4 to avoid the repetition of rhythmic ideas which often can occur in jazz ballads. I 
designed the ad-lib improvisation of the second tenor to provide spontaneous interaction with

these two thematic melodies. In addition, I also employed a soft fluttertongue played by two 
alto saxophones to imitate the tremolo technique heard in sueng performance (Figure 7.68).

Another noticeable technique applied in this section is the application of multiple types of 
subdivision in the organ and guitar to contribute the rhythmic density and to create rhythmic 
contradiction against the main melodic patterns and bass lines. As shown in figure 7.69, both 
the organ and guitar players produced complex rhythm patterns in triplet and sixteenth-note 
settings.

The thematic melody of “Selemao”324 (Figure 7.70), also functions as compositional material 
and is prominently heard in the scat singing of the vocalist in the E section. My intention in 
composing this section is to arrange this northern Thai melody in changing time signatures, 
and to add rhythmic complexity techniques to the original melody. I applied the various meter 
changes between 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4, which provide a sense of unpredictability. In addition, I 
also applied melodic diminution and augmentation to create melodic patterns that are distinct 
from the original version. Similar to other sections, I also used interval transposition to generate 
a key modulation (Figure 7.71).

Compositional techniques are noted in the colored boxes. 
 
As has been mentioned, this composition’s harmonic approach is based on providing coloristic 
harmonies to emphasize the sound of the tension of the melodic lines. To generate these 
musical effects, I applied several extended chords such as maj7♯11, maj13♯11 min9, min11, and 
13sus chords to appropriate melodies in various parts of the E section. This conceptual approach 
can generate contemporary jazz harmonies out of a northern Thai melody, and invigorate the 
sound of Thai music by integrating elements of modern jazz (Figure 7.72).

function as tension-producing pitches in those harmonies.  
 
The F section is the first improvisation section, which develops towards the piece’s climax. In 
this section, I employ several compositional techniques to stimulate audiences’ emotions. I 
composed melodic lines for the lead trumpet, second tenor (soprano saxophone), second alto, 
and the lead trombone, which constitute the recapitulation of the main melodic lines of 
“Selemao” (mm.73-76). This recapitulation is also reinforced by accompanying semi-tutti 
passages performed by alto, tenor saxophones, three trumpets, first and second trombones, 
and rhythmic section to create and contribute more dynamic to this particular section. The

improvisation of drums also appears in the F section, generating a dynamic performance that 
interacts with the melodic recapitulation and the tutti passage (Figure 7.73).

The second improvisation section at G includes the improvisation of drums and lead alto

changes can be heard as longer measures reducing their duration by one beat at a time: 7/4

(3/4+4/4), 6/4 (3/4+3/4), 5/4 (2/4 + 3/4) as explicitly demonstrated from mm. 85 to mm. 
90 (Figure 7.74). I constructed distinctive bass lines and percussive accompaniments performed 
by various instruments to integrate with meter changes and to provide complicated rhythmic 
ideas in this section. Importantly, the recapitulation of the melody of “Selemao” can also be 
heard from the vocal and bass trombone (mm. 84-89), as I attempt to encapsulate the story of 
this composition before reaching its climax a few measures later.

The final section of improvisation in “The Northern Rhapsody” is the H section. My primary 
intention here is to create a release and unwind the audiences’ emotions after prolonged 
listening to complex harmonic chord progressions, and to changing, irregular meters. To 
provide such an even-tempered atmosphere decreased the musical intensity, I constructed a 
simple chord progression moving between A7sus4 and G7sus4 and back again, with improvisation 
by the pianist and lead alto (soprano saxophone) in an 11/8 blues shuffle feel. Later on, the 
guitar again imitates sueng performance, playing melodies in G major pentatonic and F major 
pentatonic along with a tremolo technique. The ostinato in the bass also strengthens the 
rhythmic stability of this section (Figure 7.75).

7.6 CONCLUSION  
  
In the compositional process of this chapter, emphasizing the “assimilation to innovation” 
concept of Walter Bishop Jr. (quoted by Berliner), I show how I employed several Thai music 
traditional elements, such as its fundamental melody, idiomatic instruments, musical texture, 
and rhythms, to use as the core musical elements of my original composition. Rather than 
applying such musical components directly and noticeably to my composition as I had done in 
earlier projects, I blended them with my own interpretation to create complex layers where 
Thai musical influences are intertwined with my original compositional material. This produces 
hybridity that integrates the musical elements of jazz and Thai music, highlighting principles of 
musical innovation. Examples of my compositional processes include:  
 
1) transforming Thai melodies to intermingle with contemporary jazz musical 
elements;  
2) incorporating Thai melodies and combining them with my own melodies to create 
thematic melodies;  
3) employing melodic lines from Thai musical traditions in one layer to interact with 
my original melodic lines in a second layer, which simulate Thai musical textures;  
4) adapting Thai idiomatic instruments to jazz orchestra instruments;  
5) modifying Thai rhythmic patterns to be used in the rhythm section such as in the 
bass and percussion parts;  
6) applying Thai compositional techniques to jazz orchestra composition; and 
7) converting Thai literature into monologues to be read, to interact with jazz styles. 
 
In addition, I also used synthesizer, pedal effects, electric bass, and drum machines to express 
traditional Thai musical elements through contemporary timbres, which had a significant 
impact on my compositional perspective and process. 
 
In evaluating the compositional experiences of working in four different regions of Thai music 
traditions, I found that isan nuea musical elements appear to be more flexible when applying its 
traditional melodies. These elements operate well with contemporary jazz harmonies, as can 
isan nuea instrument techniques, which can be effectively adapted by western instruments, such 
as alto saxophone or electric guitar. Rong ngeng rhythmic patterns performed by bass, as well as 
the khuen hua pi technique of nora as applied to soprano saxophone, appear to incorporate well 
",353,2439
276," 
CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
260 
with Afro-Cuban beats and drum patterns with backbeats. The adaptation of polyphonic 
stratification derived from Thai classical music textures resulted in an interesting resource for 
jazz composing methods. This approach introduced multiple independent lines into the jazz 
orchestra music texture, resulting sounds quite distinct from the styles of section writing used 
in conventional jazz orchestra compositions. The use of khap saw performance from northern 
Thai music performances can be used in the woodwind section, particularly for the flute and 
clarinet, to establish a texture almost like a fugue. In addition to the musical elements 
mentioned above, I found that the use of Thai literature, such as the interpretation of Thai 
poetry in “Patchim” (“Epilogue”), and the use of Pra Suthon and Manora’s monologues in 
“Singora” (“Dance of Kinnari”), contribute yet another interesting method of presenting the 
Thai aspects into jazz orchestra performances.  
 
When it came to obstacles I had to overcome while working on this project, I sometimes found 
it difficult to produce references to Thai idiomatic instruments such as the ti kep, which is 
played by ranad ek, in woodwinds, brass, or vocals. To avoid such issues, I had to locate 
appropriate instruments to play such specialized approaches, for example, a vibraphone, guitar, 
or synthesizer, or I had to break such techniques down into small motifs so that a woodwind 
instrument could execute them. Second, to avoid the pentatonic scale’s repetitive sound, which 
is the core structure of many Thai music traditions, I used key modulation or slightly adjusted 
interval patterns or applied metric modulations, which may provide a productive distraction 
from the penta-centric concept. As a result, I discovered that such compositional strategies 
work effectively, particularly in the piece “Mekong,” which I believe is an exemplary case of 
avoiding the recurrence of pentatonic scales while also increasing the complexity of Thai 
melodies through a variety of jazz composition approaches. 
 
The most essential point, however, is how the balance between Thai musical traditions and 
jazz is achieved. While working on sketch scores, I carefully considered the degree to which 
Thai and jazz musical elements should each be included in the original compositions, and my 
final goal was to convey those musical elements equally. This process can be seen in multiple 
parts of the original compositions, with one example being the presence of Thai musical 
influences in the background as interplay with soloists in improvisation sections, where my 
objective is to keep the Thai musical elements intact even when a soloist is improvising. 
However, as mentioned previously in the introduction to this chapter, I situate these works as 
examples of musical hybridization, which is defined as the blending of more than two distinct 
",451,2971
277," 
CHAPTER 7: Jazz Orchestra Portraits of Thailand 
 
 
261 
cultures to create a new one that sounds different from its parts. Therefore, rather than aiming 
for levels of Thainess (Kwarm pen Thai) or of jazz styles from conventional perspectives, I would 
like to encourage listeners to evaluate and consider these works in terms of musical creativities 
and innovations.

 Conclusion  
 
The fundamental of music is that it has been in harmony with different societies since the beginning. 
But in some periods, we develop ourselves into artists’ egos, and the musician becomes a separatist. We 
also overlook the fact that music is as diverse as ethnicity, language, people. Anthropology teaches us to 
embrace differences in music, just as it teaches us to appreciate musical diversity.325

8.1 ARTISTIC EXPERIENCES  
 
This research project came about as a result of my extensive learning of Thai traditional music, 
which included three distinct stages: transcribing (which I often refer to as learning by ear), 
reviewing previous literature, and creating my own original works, all of which came to 
permeate both my written thesis and my compositions. In total, I created nine prototype 
compositions, one double bass crossover improvisation, and seven jazz orchestra pieces 
totaling 67 minutes. My thesis encompasses comprehensive analysis, and four chapters of 
comprehensive discussions of Thai music elements including twenty-four transcriptions, all of 
which demonstrate my methods and experiences in attempting to comprehend Thai music 
traditions from my perspective and background as a jazz performer and composer. It is my

hope that this study, now complete, will be beneficial to many composers and scholars, 
including composers from any background who are interested in Thai music traditions. 
 
My research questions led me to musical experiences of attempting to combine aspects of jazz 
and Thai music. Although these two genres are entirely distinct due to their geographical 
origins, several Thai musical structures are comprehensible to practitioners of jazz (related to 
my first research question). Some examples include:  
 
1) the comparison of Thai classical music to jazz musical forms;  
2) the idiomatic improvisation of Thai classical musician based on luk tok similar to jazz 
performers who learn to improvise by using target pitches;  
3) the correlation between Thai classical compositional techniques and the 
compositional method of jazz (e.g., luk yon [pedal point] or thang plien [melodic 
variation]);  
4) the concept of thang khreuang dontri, which refers to a style of instrumental music used 
in Thai classical performance to create Thai music texture––employed in jazz 
orchestra writing it can produce independent melodic lines;  
5) the performance of thang dio, which uses instrumental techniques similar to Western 
music; 
6) the performance methods of khaen, and pi jum, which are primarily based on the 
construction of intervallic patterns similar to an approach to jazz improvisation;  
7) the accompaniment of khaen and phin which produce equivalents to suspended chords 
in jazz harmony;  
8) the use of Dorian mode in salo-pin compositions; and 
9) the similarities between the rhythmic accents of isan nuea music, sueng, and khap saw 
performances and the swing feel, all of which emphasize the upbeat. 
 
These musical experiences have revealed to me that even when working with music from two 
or more distinct musical traditions, there are always some common aspects that may be 
effectively modified.  
 
As I indicated previously that my philosophical idea is based on a pragmatic approach, I believe 
that transcribing Thai music elements into Western notation has also provided me with a 
practical approach to modifying Thai music elements for use in jazz compositions (related to 
",340,2247

CHAPTER 8: Conclusion 
 
 
264 
my second research question). This method provided me with insight into how musicians of 
Thai traditions perform their music. While transcribing, I was able to absorb the character of 
the various types of Thai music, allowing me to establish the concept of “the Thai sound” in 
my consciousness, which was similar to my initial step in learning to improvise on jazz. The 
successful output produced by the transcription process is explicitly illustrated in my analysis 
in chapters on Thai traditions, my prototype compositions, and my jazz orchestra work. 
Examples include:  
 
1) the use of a jazz analysis approach to stimulate melodies modeled (equivalent to jazz 
licks) from Thai classical music and northern Thai salo (saw) pin transcriptions;  
2) the imitation of khaen, phin, and sueng played by alto saxophone and guitar, which I 
adapted from transcriptions of isan nuea music;  
3) the compositional methods that I employed in the soprano saxophone derived from 
the transcription of khuen hua pi techniques in Chapter 5; 
4) the transcriptions of Thai classical music rhythms (nathap) and rong ngeng rhythmic 
patterns, which were used in the bass parts in the original works; and  
5) numerous Thai melodies that were obtained through the transcription processes and 
afterward used in original pieces. 
 
The transcribing processes, in contrast from learning from literature alone, granted me with 
individual compositional aspects, which I then applied to my compositional processes 
throughout this research.  
  
In the artistic experience of working to balance the musical elements of Thai music and jazz in 
my compositional process (my third research question), I also encountered a significant 
challenge in maintaining both two musical aspects equally. My intent was, and is, to create 
musical works that could be attractive to both jazz and Thai audiences. Several questions come 
to mind while I worked on this project, such as: Why does this section sound “too” jazz, or 
why does this section appear to be “too” Thai? And are these works interesting from the 
viewpoint of jazz composition? Will Thai composers and traditional musicians be interested in 
these works? In one straightforward example, I encountered a challenge when working on the 
rhythm of Thai melodies. It appeared to me that I could not use too many syncopated beats 
since it would diminish the impression of Thai melodic character, but if I did not supply any 
syncopated rhythms, the melodies would lack one of the significant features of jazz. As a result, 
",407,2598
281," 
CHAPTER 8: Conclusion 
 
 
265 
I have had to pay close attention to the amounts of Thai and jazz musical elements that I put 
into this project in order to produce musical hybridizations, which are still innovative and 
distinct from those created by other composers who have previously worked on cross-cultural 
Thai music projects, some of which are mentioned in Chapter 2. 
 
The timbres of Thai instruments, which can play an important part in providing Thai musical 
characteristics, are something I found lacking in this project, in a somewhat unsatisfying way. 
Even though I attempted to employed western instruments from similar instrument families 
to reference or imitate the timbre of Thai instruments, such as a soprano saxophone for the pi 
nora (reed instrument) or a vibraphone for the ranad ek (xylophone), I found it was difficult for 
western instruments to accommodate the unique timbre of Thai instruments that constitute 
the actual sonic experience of Thai musical traditions, and could, theoretically, be used to 
balance the musical timbre between jazz and Thai features. In the future, I plan to compose 
for Thai instruments as an important part of my jazz orchestra music.  
 
The difference in tuning systems between Thai instruments and Western instruments presented 
me with my greatest challenge to the concept of “learning by ear” while working on this 
research (related to my fourth research question). The tuning systems of Thai and Western 
instruments are categorically different, and it is common to find traditional Thai instruments 
to be “out of tune” in terms of Western music perception. Consequently, I would advise jazz 
composers to take proper care when choosing recordings for transcribing. Although Thai 
traditional instruments may employ different tuning systems, several have been adapted to 
Western tuning (sieng sakon) and played in fusion bands, as mentioned by my interviewee 
Somuek Saengarun and discussed in John Garzoli’s dissertation. These instruments, such as pi 
nai, ranad ek, khlui, khaen, phin, pi nora, and sueng are frequently available in Western tunings that 
may be ideal for jazz composers to use for transcription, and for hybridization projects.  
 
Another obstacle I encountered during this research was the difference between Thai and 
Western music in their notions of rhythm. Thai musicians, unlike Western musicians, do not 
perform at a steady tempo, which is indicated in music scores. As a result, the tempo of Thai 
music might be slow or fast depending on the performer’s perception, in particular regional 
traditional Thai music, such as isan nuea or lanna music, which do not include a ching player in 
ensembles. Regarding the time signature I used in my transcription processes, I still believe that 
the use of 2/4 meter, first introduced by the Thai Fine Arts Department committee in 1929, 
",451,2889
282," 
CHAPTER 8: Conclusion 
 
 
266 
can help us to understand Thai rhythmic phrases more easily, as well as being more useful for 
sight reading. I also observed that using Thai nathap on drums does not seem to work well in a 
jazz orchestra setting, so I had to employ them in the bass parts instead. And, if I try to 
syncopate such beat patterns, the Thai rhythmic character will be lost. As a consequence, I will 
require further study, and more time, to concentrate solely on the rhythms of Thai classical 
music, which I will attempt in a future project. Interestingly, when transcribing regional music 
from the Northeast (khaen and phin performances) and the North (khap saw performances), I 
observed that these two rhythmic patterns are characterized by rhythmic accents on the upbeat, 
a feature shared with the swing feel. Having a rhythmic similarity can be beneficial when 
attempting to integrate Thai melodies from these two regions with jazz musical components. 
 
8.2 DEFINING AN ARTISTIC POSITION 
 
One of the most important developments I have made as a result of this research is in my 
artistic identity and position as composer engaged in musical hybridization. My artistic aim is 
to offer Thai musical qualities and express the essence of Thai music through a contemporary 
perspective, as indicated by the music I composed for this project. Unlike my previous projects, 
where I was concerned about my Thainess, and in which I intended my works to sound “Thai” 
to Thai musicians, this research project has allowed me to break free from such limiting 
attitudes and cultural boundaries. I also learned that the most appealing aspect of being a 
composer of musical hybridization is being honest with yourself and using your originality to 
interpret musical traditions. As a result, these seven jazz orchestra compositions reflect my 
feelings on Thai qualities that are not overtly influenced by traditional or progressive 
viewpoints on Thai music. These compositions demonstrate how I personally perceive Thai 
characteristics that I chose to express in my jazz-oriented compositional process. 
 
I have found that the jazz and Thai music traditions, among others, have traditionalists and 
progressivists continually debating notions of authenticity and purity. However, after spending 
a significant amount of time studying these two musical cultures, I discovered that what appeals 
to me about them is their shared practice of multiculturalism, their shared openness to foreign 
cultures that allowed these two styles to blend effectively with other musical influences and, in 
my project, with one another. These two musical cultures seem to join ethnomusicologists in 
",422,2703
283," 
CHAPTER 8: Conclusion 
 
 
267 
remaining skeptical about “purity,” agreeing that “no traditional music is ever static, since 
changes must appear during the transmission.”326 
 
Though I still believe that the term “tradition” can provide “authentic” experiences to 
audiences and these two words also should be granted to both jazz and Thai musicians who 
have committed their lives to these two kinds of music in the past, I would like to convince 
other traditionalists that without openness and a progressive outlook, these two styles of music 
would become rigid and lack diversity, in contradiction to their origins. Wayne Shorter, a 
legendary jazz musician who has experienced the growth of jazz over the years, supports this 
idea: 
Jazz should not have any mandates. Jazz is not supposed to be something that you are required to sound 
like jazz. For me, the word jazz means, I dare you. And the effort to break out of something is worth 
more than you getting an A in syncopation.327 
 
Asdavuth Sagarik, a prominent Thai classical musician, offers another perspective:  
 
The question is, why do we need to preserve Thai music? It really doesn’t need to be preserved. 
Everything has its own time. When the term “preservation” is mentioned, it is separated into two 
categories: conservative and progressive. In reality, everyone possesses both conservative and 
progressive qualities.328 
 
Cultures have always changed and evolved. It is natural for one culture to interact with another 
to create something new. The original works composed for this research have illustrated what 
strategies can be used to produce creative works that incorporate the musical knowledge of 
two musical traditions with different origins. My musicianship and jazz expertise collided with 
my Thai identity to generate musical works that I refer to as “hybrid products.” These musical 
hybridizations came about through the infusion, integration, and exchange of jazz 
compositional techniques and Thai music elements demonstrated in the creative component 
of this project.

8.3 FUTURE WORK AND CONCLUSION 
 
One objective of my research was to add a Thai branch to Duke Ellington’s jazz tree. In fact, 
though the globalization of jazz is explicitly described in the works of Stuart Nicholson and E. 
Taylor Atkins, to name but two, the jazz world seems to pay little attention to Thai musical 
traditions, just as it marginalizes many other musical traditions around the world. I am hopeful 
that the creative output of my project will be used as musical evidence of the merging of jazz 
and the traditional music of Thailand. I also hope that my research methodology can be applied 
to study other musical traditions to enhance the level of diversity in jazz cultures. 
 
My future work will continue to explore other musical traditions, cultural diversity, and music 
in a global context. I believe we can learn from our differences and establish new intellectual 
cultures by combining our different perspectives, as underlined in Kwame Anthony Appiah’s 
discussion of cosmopolitanism. I will start composing for Thai traditional instruments, an 
experience that I have lacked in this project, and then employ them to perform with my jazz 
orchestra, a group I aim to form as a professional ensemble in Thailand. Traditional 
instruments from outside Thailand which I am looking forward to working on my jazz 
orchestra project, including koto, saung, erhu, and serunai, which I will spend more time learning 
using the research approaches with which I have become familiar in this study. 
 
Beyond conventional jazz composition approaches, there are a vast number of approaches 
available to jazz composers that can motivate and inspire. Some composers may turn to 21st-
century classical composition techniques, such as acoustic and electronic compositional 
techniques, while others may seek to revisit and revise the musical achievements and brilliance 
of prominent jazz composers of the past. I decided to turn to the sound of traditional music, 
which I believe is a form of musical knowledge that has been cultivated through many 
generations. Among the many things that I gained from learning traditional music, the most 
fascinating element of being a jazz composer who studies traditional music is that I am able to 
combine musical knowledge from the past with my own compositional ideas rooted in jazz. At 
the same time, I can participate in preserving traditional voices, which are likely to become lost 
as time passes, and present them through the musical features of a contemporary jazz orchestra, 
and incorporating other musical elements, including alternative rock, hip-hop, R&B, and 
electronica.

CHAPTER 8: Conclusion 
 
 
269 
This research demonstrates several practical approaches to how jazz composers can draw on 
Thai music traditions to generate innovative methods for composing music, particularly for a 
jazz orchestra. Beyond musical genres, authenticities, and national identities, I reckon there is 
much we can learn from one another to create and develop new creative perceptions that are 
inspired by other humans.

APPENDIX B: INTERVIEWS   
This appendix contains interview questions and answers between Somnuek Saengarun and 
Perico Sambeat, which were conducted via Zoom July 27-28, 2020. These questions were 
designed to show the compositional process and artistic experiences in the context of cross-
cultural jazz compositions. These two interviews were approved by the Human Ethics 
Committee at Victoria University of Wellington. The Ethic Approval no. 27969. 
 
Interviewee: Somnuek Saengarun 
 
Time: 35 minutes 
 
 
Tanarat Chaichana: Could you please describe how you go about learning to play traditional 
Thai instruments? Also, what were your teacher’s approaches for transmitting musical 
knowledge to you? 
 
Somnuek Saengarun: I was born into a musical family. As a result, learning music was a 
regular activity of my childhood. My grandfather taught me how to play khong wong yai. As I 
grew older, I began to learn different instruments. Every evening after dinner, I had to go to 
my grandfather’s house to study music. My father used to wake me up at 5 a.m. to practice 
music. This has been my daily ritual since I was a child. 
 
TC: Ok. As a result, what tactics did your grandfather employ to instruct you? Is it something 
you have to recite or sing in Thai notes? 
 
SS: So, my grandfather taught me by playing music on instruments, and I had to follow what 
he did exactly. At the time, there were no Thai musical notations. Thai musical notation was 
only used by Thai musicians who were studying in government-funded music institutes. In 
addition, my grandfather also sang melodic lines by mimicking the sounds of instruments, 
which I had to convert to instruments and play. 
 
TC: Yes, that’s why I was really impressed by Thai classical musicians. Because the sounds of 
Thai classical compositions are incredibly complicated, you have to learn everything from 
phrase to phrase. This process indeed requires a lot of time. So, my next question is still about 
",322,2017
320," 
APPENDIX B: Interviews 
 
 
304 
the general concept of Thai classical music. Can you explain why the majority of Thai classical 
musicians can play practically every instrument in a Thai ensemble? Was this also necessary for 
your learning process? 
 
SS: The most significant aspect, in my opinion, is that every Thai musician must first learn to 
play khong wong yai in order to master the fundamental melody known as thamnong lak. This 
thematic melody can then be applied to different instruments according to their idioms, which 
you can think of as plae thamnong approaches. As a result, once Thai musicians have mastered 
the fundamental melody, which is the first level of study, they want to increase their musical 
expertise by learning other instruments.  
 
TC: Could you kindly explain how to conduct plae thamnong approaches (a musical technique 
in which a player asks that a fundamental melody be interpreted and played on their 
instruments)? To what extent can Thai musicians improvise when performing such techniques? 
 
SS: To begin, you must understand that Thai classical music is separated into two categories: 
phleng bangkhap thang (a composition which does not enable a musician to improvise) and phleng 
mai bangkhap thang (a composition that allows a player to improvise). “Lao Duang Duen,” 
“Khmer Sai Yok,” and “Saen Kham Nung,” for example, are musical pieces in the phleng 
bangkhap thang genre. The phleng mai bangkhap thang category comprises phleng Thayoi (เพลงทยอย) 
compositions. Interestingly, there are also Thai compositions that players must conduct both 
plae thamnong, and strictly play the specific melodic lines that are instructed by their teachers. To 
best answer your question, I believe you should learn to play Thai instruments. 
 
TC: Yes, thank you! I’ve examined Montri Tramote’s books. He also showcased a few other 
types of Thai compositions. What about the category of phleng naphat? Is it possible for Thai 
musicians to improvise over the thematic melody on such a piece? 
 
SS: Yes, absolutely. In the phleng naphat genre, Thai musicians must improvise (plae thamnong). 
Experienced Thai musicians, in particular, enjoy demonstrating their musical abilities through 
phleng naphat performances. The more experience they have with Thai music, the better they 
are at using the plae thamnong technique. 
 
",364,2368

APPENDIX B: Interviews 
 
 
305 
TC: Thank you! I would like to expand on my question regarding the musical composing 
approaches that your teacher taught you. How did your teachers begin teaching you how to 
compose traditional Thai music? 
 
SS: I think you ask the right person here, because of my research concerning Thai composition 
techniques. Sanoh Luangsuntorn, a pupil of Luang Pradit Pairoh (Son Silpabanleng), was my 
Thai music composition teacher. Again, you must keep in mind that Thai musicians dislike 
writing things down on paper, so the teaching methods of Thai composition were also 
transmitted orally from teachers to pupils. However, Sanoh Luangsuntorn, my teacher, was 
one of a few Thai composers who wrote about Thai compositional methods. There are a lot 
of different ways to compose Thai music, and I’ll show you some of them. To begin with, 1) 
Thai composers create music based on their imaginations. This might be accomplished by Thai 
composers beginning to play the sounds they hear on instruments, and then asking their pupils 
to help them in remembering such tunes. 2) composers may take the melodies from old 
compositions and use them as the basis for new creations. This could be accomplished using a 
variety of strategies, such as augmentation and diminution techniques, melodic embellishments 
(thang kro, luk leuam), building extra sections (luk yon), and so on. Lastly, composers may use the 
thao compositional method, which is similar to the augmentation and diminution strategies I 
described earlier. However, Thai composers must pay close attention to the sound of luk tok 
(target pitches) when using this method. 
 
TC: Yes, I've learned that several Thai compositional techniques are similar to those employed 
in western music, such as providing a solo passage for instruments (a cadenza). As you 
have learned western and Thai music, could you please give a brief comment on this? 
 
SS: Yes, I believe it is possible. Montri Tramote and Luang Pradit Pairoh (Son Silpabanleng) 
were among the Thai composers who observed the growth of western music in Thailand. And, 
I believe they may have absorbed some western influences to some extent. “Saen Kham Nung” 
is one of the examples you could consider. 
 
TC: Moving on to the concept of “nathap,” could you further explain why nathap is so 
significant to Thai music composition? 
 
",381,2391
322," 
APPENDIX B: Interviews 
 
 
306 
SS: It is really crucial. Thai composers relate nathap to a musical boundary, where each Thai 
melodic phrase must conclude with nathap’s rhythmic rhythms. The melodic patterns of phleng 
propkai compositions, for example, must fully end with the nathap propkai pattern. 
 
TC: One aspect of Thai classical music that fascinates me is the concept of cultural diversity. 
So, could you kindly elaborate on the musical approaches when performing traditional Thai 
works with a variety of musical accents? (e.g., samniang Lao, Khmer, Mon, Java, and jin) 
 
SS: Before I go into detail about this concept, you should be aware of the differences 
between nationality and ethnicity. I believe that in the past, Thai composers enjoyed imitating 
the variety of melodic accents they heard all around them. We [Thai composers] then learn to 
make certain sounds (equivalent to modes) that we may use to imitate the musical 
characteristics of those particular groups [starts to sing several compositions in samniang lao, and jin]. 
Taking “Lao Pan” as an example, I believe the goal of this piece is to mimic the sound of 
khaen's drones. And, you may be mistaken if you believe the khaen is only played in the 
northeast of Thailand or in modern-day Laos. Several pieces of evidence suggest that khaen 
was also popular in Bangkok during the Rattanakosin period. Photographs of the khaen 
ensemble sent to Europe by King Rama V with a group of Siamese diplomatic envoys are 
one example. However, you may need to conduct your own investigation into why khaen’s 
influence is decreasing. So, to get back to your question, you may have noticed that the 
drones sound that Thai composers aim to adapt from lao ethnicity can still be heard in Thai 
classic music compositions. 
 
TC: Thank you very much! Still pertaining to musical accent topic, you’re a reed player. 
Could you a briefly describe the distinction between pi nai (Thai classical music's reed 
instrument) and pi nora (a reed instrument used in nora ensembles)? 
 
SS: Again, I believe this has something to do with regional dialect. As you may know, a person 
from the center of Thailand speaks with a distinct accent different than someone from the 
south. As a result, I believe this method has had a significant impact on how we perform music. 
The ornamentation employed during performances in these two styles of music appears to be 
different. The ranges used in these two pieces of music are also distinctive. In Thai musical 
ensembles, the function of a reed instrument is to imitate vocalists. As a consequence, I believe 
that having distinct dialects has influenced the playing method. 
",439,2689
323," 
APPENDIX B: Interviews 
 
 
307 
 
TC: What is the first order of advice that you would give to jazz composers who are interested 
in learning traditional Thai music, to gain a better understanding of this genre? 
 
SS: In response to your question, I believe that learning about “respect” would be beneficial 
to such composers. I don’t mean other things when I say respect; rather, respect yourself for 
how much Thai classical music you know before embarking on a cross-cultural project. So, 
once they’ve determined their level, they can select a reasonable degree of Thai classical music 
knowledge to incorporate into their music. This, in my opinion, has nothing to do with a high 
level of expertise in Thai classical music. Even if it’s something basic, if you can come up with 
innovative ways to adapt or apply such musical elements to your music, that’s great. That seems 
to be more appealing to me. The second piece of advice to consider is cultural appropriation. 
As I previously stated, when working on these kinds of Thai-fusion works, composers should 
consider their level of Thai classical music. For example, “Sathukan” is a composition whose 
meaning is “respect.” Therefore, if someone wants to reinterpret this piece, I believe that the 
notion of respect should be brought over into their crossover pieces as well. 
 
TC: Yes, I am aware that many Thai classical music compositions are tied to a sacred ceremony.  
Are there any songs that you would warn a cross-cultural composer to avoid? 
 
SS: As in the prior response, you must undoubtedly comprehend a Thai composition on which 
you intend to work on. The more knowledge you have, the more you will understand what you 
should and shouldn’t do. In the past, Prince Paribatra arranged a number of Thai compositions 
in naphat category for Western ensembles, and you should keep in mind how conservative 
Thailand was at the time. However, today… times have changed, and please do not exploit the 
word “traditions” to construct your own wall. 
 
TC: Please accept my heartfelt gratitude, khru Somnuek. Thank you so much for opportunity to 
speak with me in this interview. I’ll see you in Thailand.

APPENDIX B: Interviews 
 
 
308 
Interviewee:  Perico Sambeat  
Interview question: 20 minutes  
Tanarat Chaichana: How did you begin to compose music for a jazz orchestra that 
combined the musical elements of flamenco and jazz?  
Perico Sambeat: Well, that came kind of naturally because I’ve been a jazz musician myself. 
I have had deep contact with flamenco music and flamenco for the last 30 years of my career. 
I had a chance to play with many of them and listen to a lot of this music. So, I think it's 
natural. It happens around the world. I would call it nationalism. Maybe, that’s something 
that happened in classical music in the 19th century, and it’s also happening now. 
TC: To add to that, is it correct you were born into a household that listened to flamenco 
music or grew up listening to flamenco music? 
PS: No, I grew up listening to mostly classical and Latin music, like boleros and all kinds of 
Cuban music. I got into flamenco when I was already near 30 years old, and I practiced this 
music and studied it the way I studied jazz. 
TC: Actually, this is quite close to me. Even though I was born in Thailand, I never had the 
opportunity to learn about the country’s traditional music when I was a child.  
TC: Could you please give brief examples of musical elements of flamenco that you apply to 
your jazz orchestra compositions (e.g., modes, melodic and rhythmic patterns, forms, 
traditional instruments timbre, etc.)?  
PS: Well, an example I don’t know. I think you have to know a little of the fundamentals of 
flamenco music to be able to create something that sounds reminiscent of that style. Flamenco 
works with what is called palo. And, palo is like different rhythms and styles. 
TC: So, you’re saying you compose your works using Flamenco rhythmic patterns? 
PS: Yeah, like another complex one that work is the pattern of siguiriyasing [begins snapping his 
fingers to show this rhythmic pattern]. 
",332,1948
325," 
APPENDIX B: Interviews 
 
 
309 
TC: Got it. Thank you, let’s move to next question. Do you agree that jazz is artistically and 
musically able to be absorbed or combined with other musical genres without losing its 
identity? If yes, what is your reason for this?  
PS:  You know African rhythm (…) and European harmony, then it got together and happened 
in the south of the United States at the beginning of last century. It had also grown and gotten 
enriched by other artists. For example, Charlie Parker played “la cucaracha.” After that, Stan 
Getz did so many records with Bossa Nova. So, I think jazz is the best tool, and we can have 
to be open-minded. 
TC: Ok. My next question also relates to your original music. I really like your musical 
compositions and have listened to your performance with the Frankfurt Radio Big Band. Also, 
I saw you put on this performance with Flamenco dances, which I think is very beautiful. So, 
in your original composition, “Tio Petila,” could you please explain what your artistic 
inspirations were and how do you developed musical ideas to compose this music?  
PS: The idea to compose that music. Well, I have basically the Bulerías pattern, because that 
pattern is a little different from the one I mentioned before and this would be something like 
[snapping fingers], and the harmonic rhythm in flamenco is a little different, but I tried to combine 
it in jazz and harmonic. The traditional flamenco harmony sound likes [playing piano]. So, to be 
more interesting I try to combine that with the Lydian flat two. Then, I created a vamp, moved 
to the fourth minor degree. Yeah, and that's basically how this music was created. 
 
TC: Yeah, and flamenco seems to include a lot of Phrygian sounds as well. Could you comment 
on this? 
 
PS: The Phrygian is the one used in flamenco, and it’s also very popular in eastern music. 
TC:  Ok, in terms of composing cross-cultural music for a jazz orchestra, what are common 
issues or prominent obstacles that you have encountered? In particular, when combining 
Spanish with jazz music. 
PS: Well, I think jazz and flamenco have a lot of things in common and a lot of improvisation 
too. Um…. I had a little problem. I decided to try not to do it in the very swing way because I 
think swing doesn’t fit much in flamenco, so most of my record is in even eighths. That’s more 
",413,2379
326," 
APPENDIX B: Interviews 
 
 
310 
like Latin jazz or something like that. But, there is some flamenco rhythm (in three-four 
patterns) that I think can be worked with swing, which I did on my previous project. (He 
started to play such rhythm on piano). 
TC: Ok. Thank you! So, I’ve got three more questions for this short period. So, this one is 
more about artistic attitudes than compositional techniques. Starting with the most relaxing 
one, what is the most pleasurable feeling that you have ever experienced since you decided to 
be a jazz composer who combines the musical elements of your country with jazz? 
PS: I think the audience is very open to this kind of cross-cultural thing. Yeah, and the things 
and they really love are definitely the dancer, which I think is a key point. Most of the audience 
really them. And, they are crazy when the dancer comes out. 
 
TC: Oh, ok! And, this one is about traditionalism vs. modernism. For example, the musical 
traditions of my country seem to be conservative. And, if you want to change something, you'll 
need to consider a number of cultural considerations. So, have you ever encountered or 
received negative feedbacks from musical traditionalists in your country when working on 
cross-cultural music projects? If yes, what are your reactions and your artistic perspectives 
based on this issue?  
PS: Well, I thought about it when I was writing it, which is on the border of respecting the 
tradition and getting into something beyond that. First of all, I think the best thing is to write 
without prejudice about all the music that comes to my mind, and if someone doesn’t like it 
I’m sorry, but at the same moment I love jazz, and I love flamenco, and I try to somehow be 
respectful with both. But, that was not something that I was forced to do. It’s just something 
that I wanted as a listener. Before my big band project, there were not many people doing big 
bang projects in flamenco and jazz, in my opinion. For example, the Sketches of Spain, and 
some other things. But none of them were very deep in flamenco. So that was my intent to go 
deep into the flamenco forms in jazz, which still sounds like flamenco. But, I tell you, I have 
no prejudices about the music that’s in my head. 
TC: Thank you! Moving on to the final question, what is your advice for jazz composers who 
are interested in composing cross-cultural music for a jazz orchestra? And, what should be the 
initial process of learning to compose such music that you would suggest to them?

PS: The advice that I would like to give to someone who aspires to be a cross-cultural jazz 
composer is that he or she should be concerned in both [types of] music, and he or she should 
study both of them deeply, and the more deeply he or she knows, the better he or she does. I 
like the colorfulness and the complexity of jazz, and that something I want to happen with 
flamenco. Maybe, I have captured only two chords in flamenco, but I think we might have to 
get a task to go a little beyond and get a little far — as much as we can, and know well which 
traditional music you want to work on and then take it to the complexity and the beauty of jazz 
both together. I mean you must know both of them deeply.  
 
TC: That’s the perfect answer. Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Perico Sambeat.

APPENDIX C: TRANSCRIPTION MIDI 
RECORDINGS  
The MIDI recordings used in chapters 3-6 can be found in this appendix. I chose to make 
these recordings available to composers who want to learn more about Thai musical traditions. 
They can also be used by students, faculty, and members of the general public for non-profit 
educational purposes only, with the author’s permission.

507,"Monologue 1 (m.25-m.58)  
Pra Suthon and Manora is a story of forbidden love between a human and a female mythical figure, 
who is half-bird and half-human and lives beyond the Himavanta forest. One day, while taking a 
bath in an ancient lake in the mysterious forest of the human realm, Manora is captured by Phran 
Boon, a ferocious hunter, who later hands her over to Pra Suthon, the heir to the Kingdom of 
Uttarapancala.As soon as they see each other, they fall in love because of the loving spirit that they 
had in their past lives. However, a jealous brahmin falsely tells the king, Artit Wong, Pra Suthon’s 
father, that Manora would bring about a deterioration of his reign and requests the sacrifice of 
Manora. So reluctantly, Manora leaves Pra Suthon behind without saying goodbye and secretly flees 
to Mouth Kailash, where humans are unable to go.  
Monologue 2 (m.215- m.244)  
“I insistently forbid him to follow me because the journey to the realm of Kinnari, a world of half-bird 
and half-human, is extremely perilous. The route to my world is certainly not for humans, but for 
non- humans only,” says Manora. However, despite the warning, Pra Suthonstill relentlessly chases 
her and wishes to bring his lover back. Along the way, Pra Suthon encounters several poisonous 
forests and a flooded river where a colossal python lies as an obstacle. Then he must sneak into the 
nest of the gigantic birds in the mythical world, where he must be patient and wait until all ferocious 
creatures fly away so that he can slowly climb up to the top of Mouth Kailash where he will 
eventually be reunited with his love. The journey of Pra Suthon and Manora took seven years, seven 
months, and seven days, providing us with a great story of persistence and showing usthe power of 
love to overcome difference—in this case, between human and non-human.”

The sunrise and the moonset, we used to live happily together. 
 
But now we have to depart. Only the empty sky will remind the old to be sad. 
 
Oh, my dearest jasmine, why do you have to remind me of the dewdrop on your leaf?  
 
The feeling that I used to touch, the delicate fragrance that I used to smell. 
 
It is at this time that the wind blows and flutters and brings the clouds to the sky, and my eyes 
could not follow. 
 
Does no one know how deep is the ocean? Does no one know how deep is your heart? 
 
Oh, my dearest dahlia, the flower of my love, the flower I carefully planted, but no one knows 
who has taken. Now my heart will be broken, and my soul will be lost. 
 
It is at this time that we nearly see each other, but we still remain apart. 
 
Because you are the moonset at dawn and I’m the sundown at dusk. Thus, we cannot see each 
other in the same sky.
